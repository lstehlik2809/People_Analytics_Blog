I am a psychologist who is quite good friend with mathematics and statistics - in the past, as a researcher and lecturer at the [Department of Psychology at Charles University in Prague](https://kps.ff.cuni.cz/cs/), I have relied on both disciplines to study and teach the workings of the human mind, and now, as a people & data scientist, I use them to help organisations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their people-related processes. You can find more information about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludekstehlik/). In addition to this blog, I've also put some people analytics related stuff on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/lstehlik2809). You can contact me at ludek.stehlik@gmail.com.
