I’m a psychologist who’s on pretty good terms with mathematics and statistics. In the past, as a researcher and lecturer at the [Department of Psychology at Charles University in Prague](https://kps.ff.cuni.cz/cs/){target="_blank"}, I relied on both disciplines to study and teach the workings of the human mind. Now, as a people & data scientist, I use them to help organizations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their people-related processes. You can find more about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludekstehlik/){target="_blank"}. In addition to this blog, I’ve also shared some people analytics–related stuff on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/lstehlik2809){target="_blank"}. Feel free to contact me at ludek.stehlik@gmail.com.
