I suppose that many, if not the majority, of I/O psychology and people analytics folks have already heard about a new meta-analytic estimation of validity for selection procedures that is based on a more realistic range-restriction correction performed by [Sackett et al. (2022)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-17327-001){target="_blank"}.   

Numerous articles have explored the results of this meta-analysis and its presumed implications for the hiring process. However, what I found lacking was a clear visual representation of the changes in the validity estimates, including the original article.

Because I needed one for a training I was conducting on people analytics and EB-HRM, I created one. Given the nature of the change to be shown, I chose a slopegraph that nicely and intuitively illustrates a two-point change.

Maybe the visualization will come in handy for you as well when trying to "rewire" your long-held beliefs and assumptions. It should make clearer in what direction and to what extent to do so ðŸ˜‰
