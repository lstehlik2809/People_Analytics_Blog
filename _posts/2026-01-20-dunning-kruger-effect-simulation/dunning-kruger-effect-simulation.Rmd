title: 'Making abstract ideas digestible with knobs and sliders'
description: |
  With the currently available GenAI tools, it’s really a golden age for teachers who like using interactive demonstrations of abstract ideas they’re trying to convey to their students.

As an illustration from my own practice, I wanted to give the audience in a lecture on cognitive biases a tangible experience of the ideas behind the famous [“debunking”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289620300271?via%3Dihub){target="_blank"} of the even more famous phenomenon of the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect){target="_blank"} (DKE).

So I called Claude to the rescue and asked it to put together a simple simulator that would intuitively demonstrate how the typical DKE pattern can arise from measurement noise / regression to the mean, boundary constraints, and universal optimism bias (also known as the Better-Than-Average Effect) - without invoking any “dual burden of incompetence.”

Within two or three iterations, in about 5 minutes total, the simulator was good enough to use. You can check it out for yourself [here](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b82b79ef-d125-4aec-a4a1-57394f70cf63){target="_blank"}.

For anyone who teaches, lectures, or explains abstract ideas for a living - or just for fun - this kind of workflow is becoming hard to ignore.

If you’ve come across or built simple simulators, demos, or visualizations that made a hard concept finally click, feel free to share them in the comments 🤓
