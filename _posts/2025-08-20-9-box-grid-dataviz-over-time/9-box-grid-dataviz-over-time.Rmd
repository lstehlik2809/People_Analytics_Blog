In one of my projects, I‚Äôm really struggling to find an effective and intuitive way to visualize YoY movements of people within the 9-box grid - a well-known talent management tool combining information about people‚Äôs performance and potential.

Putting aside all the conceptual and philosophical objections to the 9-box - has anyone come across a good way to visualize this? Or had a good experience with something that worked?

I tried a Sankey chart, which usually does a great job at showing transitions, but in this case it didn‚Äôt preserve the ‚Äú2D logic‚Äù behind the grid - or at least I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to make it work. 

The best idea I‚Äôve got so far is shown below, including the R code behind it. It sort of does the job, but only if I visualize it cell by cell, which isn‚Äôt ideal, especially outside the dashboard environment ü´§

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=7}

# --- 1. SETUP ---
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)

# --- SET PARAMETERS FOR STARTING CELL ---
# Change these values (from 1 to 3) to filter for a different starting cell.
# 1 = Low, 2 = Medium, 3 = High
start_perf_filter <- 1
start_pot_filter <- 1


# --- 2. SAMPLE DATA GENERATION ---
# Set a seed for reproducibility of the random data
set.seed(42)

n_employees <- 1000 

# Helper function to generate scores
generate_scores <- function(n) {
  score1 <- sample(1:3, n, replace = TRUE)
  score2 <- sapply(score1, function(s) {
    change <- runif(1)
    if (change < 0.6) s # 60% chance to stay
    else if (change < 0.8) min(3, s + 1) # 20% chance to increase
    else max(1, s - 1) # 20% chance to decrease
  })
  list(score1 = score1, score2 = score2)
}

# Create the initial wide-format data frame
perf <- generate_scores(n_employees)
pot <- generate_scores(n_employees)

talent_data_wide <- data.frame(
  id = 1:n_employees, # Using numeric IDs instead of names
  year1_perf = perf$score1,
  year1_pot = pot$score1,
  year2_perf = perf$score2,
  year2_pot = pot$score2
)

# --- 3. DATA PROCESSING, SIMULATING LEAVERS & NEW HIRES ---

# Identify employees who started in the specified cell
source_employee_ids <- talent_data_wide %>%
  filter(year1_perf == start_perf_filter & year1_pot == start_pot_filter) %>%
  pull(id)

# Simulate leavers: randomly select 15% of source employees to have NA in year 2
leaver_ids <- sample(source_employee_ids, size = floor(0.15 * length(source_employee_ids)))
talent_data_wide <- talent_data_wide %>%
  mutate(
    year2_perf = ifelse(id %in% leaver_ids, NA, year2_perf),
    year2_pot = ifelse(id %in% leaver_ids, NA, year2_pot)
  )
n_leavers <- length(leaver_ids)

# Simulate new hires: add 10 new people assigned to the source cell in year 2
n_new_hires <- 10

  year1_perf = NA,
  year1_pot = NA,
  year2_perf = start_perf_filter,

# Calculate transition percentages for labels based only on "Movers"

label_data <- movers_data %>%
  group_by(year2_perf, year2_pot) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%

    percentage = count / total_movers * 100,
    label_text = sprintf("%.1f%%", percentage),
    x_pos = year2_perf - 0.1,
    y_pos = year2_pot - 0.1
  )

# Prepare data for plotting trajectories (only for "Movers")

Would be super grateful for any tips or suggestions on dataviz tools or approaches worth exploring üôè
