It’s easy to underestimate how much small, seemingly arbitrary factors shape long-term outcomes - especially when we’re used to telling clean stories about talent, effort, and merit.

I was reminded of this recently while reading [*Determined*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determined:_A_Science_of_Life_Without_Free_Will){target="_blank"} by [Robert Sapolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky){target="_blank"}. One striking example he discusses is school entry cutoffs. Because these dates are administrative rather than developmental, children in the same classroom can differ in age by up to ~12 months. In early childhood, that gap often translates into real differences in cognitive, emotional, and self-regulatory maturity.

Teachers may understandably interpret those differences as indicators of ability or potential. That can lead to more encouragement, attention, and higher expectations for slightly older students - advantages that already start compounding by first grade, and can continue through tracking, confidence, and parental responses.

In the UK, where the cutoff date is August 31st, this [“relative age effect”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect){target="_blank"} shows up clearly in the data. While the effect size decreases over time, it remains detectable on average through secondary school and even into university. It’s a classic example of cumulative advantage (the so-called [*Matthew Effect*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect){target="_blank"}). See the attached [chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect#/media/File:Oxford_10_years.png){target="_blank"} for illustration - it shows a near-perfect linear decline in Oxford graduation rates, with the oldest students (September) being 15% overrepresented and the youngest (August) 15% underrepresented relative to the UK norm.

And of course, school entry dates are just one example. We could start with being born into a middle-class family, in a WEIRD country, at the end of the 20th century which already places you on a very particular starting point in life. And we could keep going. If you want a better sense of the background conditions we tend to leave out of our success (and failure) narratives, *Determined* is highly recommended - even if you don’t follow Sapolsky all the way on free will.
