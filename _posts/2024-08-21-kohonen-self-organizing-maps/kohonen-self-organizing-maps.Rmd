Recently, I needed to explore the interactions of several variables in relation to a variable of interest, and I was wondering what tool could help me, until I remembered that in the distant past I had used [Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map){target="_blank"} in such situations - an artificial neural network designed for unsupervised learning that relies on competitive learning mechanism to preserve topological properties of high-dimensional data and map them onto a lower-dimensional grid for visualization and clustering.

To illustrate, I applied it to a piece of data collected by [Clearer Thinking](https://www.clearerthinking.org/){target="_blank"}, which used it to compare the [predictive performance of different popular personality test frameworks in relation to various life outcomes](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/how-accurate-are-popular-personality-test-frameworks-at-predicting-life-outcomes-a-detailed-investi){target="_blank"}. Specifically, I tried to explore the relationship between [Big Five traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits){target="_blank"} and work-life satisfaction.

```

From the maps, it is easy to see that satisfaction with work life is strongly related to Extraversion (positively) and Neuroticism (negatively) and weakly related to Conscientiousness and Openness (both positively). More importantly, however, we can also check various “exceptions” to these bivariate patterns by looking at the same specific locations across all maps. For example, one can see a group of people with higher Neuroticism (lower left corner) who nevertheless show higher work-life satisfaction, perhaps due to higher Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and partly also Openness. That's something that wouldn't be possible to find out from the pairwise plots that are usually used for similar data exploration. Check it out for yourself below.

```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=8}

# exploring the data in the pairplot
library(GGally)

GGally::ggpairs(
  mydata,
  lower = list(continuous = GGally::wrap("smooth", alpha = 0.3)),
  diag = list(continuous = GGally::wrap("densityDiag", fill = "grey"))
) +
ggplot2::theme_minimal()


```

If you find yourself in a similar situation, definitely give it a try. Happy exploration(s) 🙂
