title: 'Agentic AI for visual data exploration'
description: |
  For those who might be interested, I'm sharing an output from my experimentation with agentic AI frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph in the context of data insights democratization.

It’s a [simple app](https://ai-dataviz-exploration.streamlit.app/){target="_blank"} for plain-language exploration of a dataset from [*CultureX*](https://www.culturex.com/){target="_blank"}, containing corporate culture values across companies from different industries, measured through anonymous [*Glassdoor*](https://www.glassdoor.com){target="_blank"} reviews between Jan 1, 2023, and Apr 4, 2025.
 
It consists of several agent-like components (powered by the ChatGPT-5-mini model), each responsible for a different aspect of the insight-generation process:

* one component plans the analysis steps based on the user’s request, data characteristics, and broader context,
* another evaluates the quality of the proposed plan and suggests adjustments if necessary,
* another turns this plan into runnable code,
* another fixes potential errors in the code based on received error messages,
* another creates code for accompanying analyses to support explanation of the dataviz, and
* another transforms the results of these analyses into a concise, clear narrative for a non-technical audience.

You can see it in action in the attached video below, but feel free to try it out with your own questions [here](https://ai-dataviz-exploration.streamlit.app/){target="_blank"}. (Note: Since the app is hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud, it doesn’t stay awake continuously. If it hasn’t been used recently, you may need to wake it up and wait a few minutes.)

It usually provides good outputs even when you use really simple plain language - but based on my experiments, it helps if you know what kind of dataviz and insights you want and spell that out for the agents 😉 
 
Happy exploring 🕵️‍♀️
 
P.S. As usual, genAI can make mistakes, so don’t trust the outputs blindly - always double-check 😉
