Just came across a nice, however small (N=559) and, AFAIK, non-peer reviewed, [study](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/how-accurate-are-popular-personality-test-frameworks-at-predicting-life-outcomes-a-detailed-investi){target="_blank"} comparing accuracy of popular personality test frameworks at predicting 37 different life outcomes (e.g., frequency of exercise, life satisfaction, number of close friends, etc.). 

The main findings? They shouldn't be a big surprise to I/O psych folks, but IMO they still contain two or three interesting, not widely known details.

* The Big Five personality test was more accurate than Jungian (MBTI-based) and Enneagram tests in predicting life outcomes. Fun fact, MBTI-style test was halfway between science and astrology, literally üßôÔ∏è 
* The accuracy of these tools is negatively related to their popularity as measured by the frequency of Google searches. 
* Removing Neuroticism from the Big Five reduced its predictive power significantly. 
* Most personality traits form bell curves, suggesting that MBTI‚Äôs binary categorization may be less accurate. 
* Continuous scores in the Jungian framework improved predictions over binary categories, but even with adjustments, the Big Five (minus Neuroticism) slightly outperformed the modified Jungian test. 
* Jungian traits correlated with specific Big Five traits, but combining both tests didn't enhance predictive accuracy. 
* Despite its simplicity, the Enneagram performed better than the binary Jungian Type but was still less effective than the Big Five. 
* Participants preferred their Jungian assessments, likely due to its more positive framing and missing Neuroticism trait.
