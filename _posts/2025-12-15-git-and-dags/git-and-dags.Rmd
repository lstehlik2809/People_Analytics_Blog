Not being a heavy Git user, I was surprised to learn that to gain a deeper understanding and a solid mental model of how Git works, DAGs - well known from the world of causal inference, where I feel a bit more at home - are very handy. They make it much easier to deal with more complex operations like rebasing or fixing merge conflicts - at its core, it’s just graph manipulation. 

Maybe I’m not the only one who was ignorant of this, so I’m sharing this small but useful learning of mine 🤓 

If interested, check out, for example, the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ala6PHlYjmw&t=8s){target="_blank"}, which, imo, does a decent job of explaining Git through a DAG lens.
