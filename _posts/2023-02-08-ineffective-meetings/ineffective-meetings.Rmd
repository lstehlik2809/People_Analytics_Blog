The list below is based on [Geimer et al.’s 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296315000879) paper “Meetings at work: Perceived effectiveness and recommended improvements”.

**PEOPLE SIDE:**
🚫 Late arrive
🚫 Unprepared attendees
🚫 One-way (top-down) communication
🚫 Lack of open-mindedness & empathy
🚫 Self-promotion, people talk just to appear to add value, and hidden agenda
🚫 People interrupt/talk during meeting
🚫 Interpersonal conflicts, incivility, and disrespect

**MEETING ORGANIZATION SIDE:**
✅ Agenda
✅ Distribution of agenda in advance
🚫 Lack of direction/goals
✅ Chaired effectively
🚫 Meetings held just to have them, just a routine with no real purpose
🚫 Appropriate parties are not invited and inappropriate parties are invited
🚫 Too many attendees
🚫 Time conflicts
🚫 Meet at inappropriate intervals
🚫 Meetings take too long
🚫 Takes time to travel to meeting

**MEETING ACTIVITIES SIDE:**
🚫 Insufficient interaction, meeting activities are monotonous and boring
🚫 No new information
🚫 Discussion gets off target
🚫 Core issues not discussed
🚫 Lack of clarity about what the attendee is supposed to do

**MEETING OUTCOMES SIDE:**
🚫 Inaction post-meeting
🚫 Decisions have already been made, just a rubber stamp

Do you identify with the above reasons? Is there anything that you think is missing from the list, particularly as the workplaces have been operating more remotely/hybrid way since 2015?

P.S. In the next post let’s check what suggestions people have for improving the effectiveness of meetings.
