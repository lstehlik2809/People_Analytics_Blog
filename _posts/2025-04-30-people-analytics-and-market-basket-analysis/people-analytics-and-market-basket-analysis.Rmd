Early in my data science journey, one method that kept popping up in courses and materials was market basket analysisâ€”a simple technique designed to identify items that commonly occur together, typically in retail scenarios.

Despite its popularity, up until recently, I never really found a practical use for this method in my day-to-day work. But now, after many years, I finally came across a situation in a PA project where it actually came in handy. The task was to identify, within a team profile analysis, which pairs or trios of motivesâ€”as measured by the MVPI methodâ€”tend to show up together in a team within individual team members. This was meant to support interpretation for those running a series of team workshops (see the illustrative chart below).

The long wait was probably simply because the PA problems Iâ€™d worked on hadnâ€™t really called for it before. But maybe it was also partly down to a lack of imagination on my part ðŸ¤” What about you? Curious if you've found this method useful in any of the common PA tasks.
