title: "Hot spots of collaboration overload and collaboration bottlenecks and how to find them"
description: |
 One of the most useful insights that can be gleaned from collaboration data is where hot spots of potential collaboration overload and/or collaboration bottlenecks may exist in a company. Such insight can be especially valuable these days, when many companies are trying to fight the upcoming economic downturn by achieving more with less.

One simple way to identify such hot spots is to compare the **outbound and inbound collaborative activities** in which teams or individuals participate. The greater the difference between the two in favor of inbound collaboration activities, the stronger the signal that collaboration overload and/or bottlenecks may be a problem for that team or individual.

To illustrate, take a look at the attached charts that show the patterns of collaboration between several teams via Slack. The distances between teams, the thickness, and the direction of the arrows between them tell us who is collaborating with whom and how much. The size of the nodes then represents the amount of inbound and outbound collaborative activities that the teams participate in, respectively. Based on the differences between them, the bar chart below shows us where the inbound collaboration activities outweigh the outbound ones the most, and therefore where the risk of collaboration overload and/or bottlenecks is greatest.

We see that the “hottest” hot spots are in teams Dev-Management and Dev-Frontend. While this is not definitive proof that we have real problems in these two specific teams, it should be a strong enough signal to take notice and try to verify our suspicion with additional information, such as checking some relevant business metrics or simply asking a few people we know should be affected, if there is a problem. If the initial suspicion is confirmed, appropriate action should be taken, e.g. consider the relevance of some requests, possibly redirect them to other teams, automate some tasks, expand the team and recruit new people, etc. 

For more tips on how to leverage collaboration data in the current uncertain economic times, I recommend reading the articles [Top 7 Collaboration Metrics to Utilize in an Economic Crisis](https://www.timeisltd.com/post/top-7-collaboration-metrics-to-utilize-in-an-economic-crisis) by [Jan Rezab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janrezab/) and [Top 6 Metrics to measure during an economic downturn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-6-metrics-measure-during-economic-downturn-shwetha-pai/) by [Shwetha Pai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwethatpai/).
