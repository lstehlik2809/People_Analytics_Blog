* Rubenstein et al.'s [meta-analysis of voluntary turnover predictors](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12226); you can also use [this app](https://peopleanalyticsblog.shinyapps.io/voluntary_turnover_predictors/) visually summarizing its results.
* Speer et al.'s article [Here to stay or go? Connecting turnover research to applied attrition modeling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334150536_Here_to_stay_or_go_Connecting_turnover_research_to_applied_attrition_modeling).
* [Demo dashboard](https://aanalytics.shinyapps.io/Turnover_Analytics_Dashboard_Demo/) for analysis of employee turnover.
