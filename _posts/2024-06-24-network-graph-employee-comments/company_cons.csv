88,"Poor compensation relative to other big four in normal years (partly driven by Deloitte's regularly claimed highest per partner pay). Exasperated in Covid with no in grade pay rises, and significant reductions to pension contributions and bonuses. Understandable that measures have to be taken but these are in excess of what competitors have done (e.g. PwC). I believe the partners should have borne more of the brunt, given they profit from every good year they should accept the risk of poorer years."
89,You are expected to work all the hours under the sun and there is just no recognition for junior grades. You are treated as a number rather than as a valued employee

116,Really bad work life balance overall
117,"- Low pay for industry and experience 
- Yearly promotion cycles where promotion decisions get made 4 months before they are given, meaning you could be working at the next grade for over 12 months before you are promoted 
- Tendency to sell roles to clients that are more senior than what will actually be staffed, meaning individuals are overworked, Deloitte are overcharging, all for the same low pay"

Lot's of 'investment' that rarely pays off and is actually just discounting. Pay is deeply disappointing, especially when you see how much the partners make. Opportunities limited beyond senior manager level if you enter the firm laterally."

132,Ultimately a disregard for well-being despite a lot of central communication
133,The pay is low for the working hours.
134,"The risk advisory position I took in Technology Digital Risk was mis sold. It is essentially IT Audit, with the 'chance' of doing advisory work 5+ years down the line if you're lucky (note its about an 80/20 split between IT audit and advisory work anyway). I doubt the advisory work is interesting and worth 5 years of your career regardless.
No career progression outside of the firm. If you stay long enough, you'll only get Internal Audit opportunities at mid and big size firms. It pigeon-holes you completely.
As a reference point, a few other grads reached out to me when they heard I was leaving as they were all feeling the same way about the job - seems like everyone is duped into this role in a way."

146,lots of crunch and additional time dedicated to role.
147,Location is a bit inconvenient

It spreads itself and its people too thin, is unable to truly become an expert in something, and will expect non-chargeable work like business development to be done no matter how many days a week you're spending on chargeable projects. Your 35 hour week contract is never met and your days are hugely fragmented. Partners not always present. It's a sink or swim company.

It's pushing a big, aggressively liberal left-modernist agenda on people, changing its in-house assessment criteria based on race, and has gone overboard on diversity and inclusion. It's getting folks down and ruffling feathers with the constant training / messaging."

492,"Tailored for Partner's.

You're dreaming if you're expecting to grow financially with them...

You will be expected to do a LOT beyond your customer engagement (up to 20 hours a week and sometimes more) with very little recognition. The joke is that you will hear a lot of music about work life balance...

Huge focus on a single subjectively negative appraisal over 10s of positive client recognized impacts. This will also impact your promotion and salary increase, if it ever happen (hope you will not be shocked with 50£ and 100£ hikes)

If you have an alternative offer, please do not overvalue Deloitte as a brand or company. Never take their offer if it's not better than the competition as you will be squeezed for every single penny you will be getting.

Be very careful with the HR and recruitment team, they are expert MANIPULATORS. They will put every pressure on you to make you feel like you will be losing a lot by no immediately accepting an offer that is not aligned with what you want. The recruitment process might take 9-12 months and they will almost seem to be proud of it, but they will ask you to think over a scrap offer overnight hinting that they have a lot of applicants waiting for the role...

Not aligned to what other consultancies do, You will be expected to pay you lunch, drinks and coffees even if you are travelling to the south pole to deliver a client project.

Don't expect to have the right support to grow. You will be thrown in the middle of the pacific and expected to reach California by yourself. Very poor coaching and average/limited training offering.

Few of my colleagues reported that they have seen a last minute change to the offer bringing the salary and the grade to lower levels while they have been promised that they will be able to get it back in 1 year and as you might be thinking: Dream on; no one of them have been able to get what he expected in day 1 after the 1st year. I came to infer that this is some sort of practice to source high caliber profiler for lower salaries, get them into clients for very high rates (sometime 2 grades higher) while they will never feel that on their salary, promotion or even recognition.

PLEASE, be careful of what choice you're making before joining. I sincerely hope you will not be deeply disappointed and (hate yourself and) regret the day you accepted their offer."
