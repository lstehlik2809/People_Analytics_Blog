You can also use it to check\r\nthe accuracy of your answers at the item level to fill in specific gaps\r\nin your knowledge.\r\nHere is the\r\nlink to the app.\r\nFeel free to share your results in the comments. Think of it as a\r\nform of public commitment to making some progress in evidence-based HRM\r\nin the coming year 😉 To walk the talk, I attached my own results. As\r\nyou can see, it’s not bad, but there is still room for improvement,\r\nespecially in the general employment practices area 😃\r\n\r\nP.S. Keep in mind that the test is based on evidence available up to\r\n2002, so it is possible that some correct answers or their contingencies\r\nmay have changed in that time. For all of them, consider, for example,\r\nthe adjustment of the estimate of the magnitude of the predictive\r\nvalidity of personnel selection procedures in their most recent meta-analysis by\r\nSackett et al. (2022). If you come across any such discrepancy, it\r\nwould be great if you share it with others in the comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As the first chart illustrates, on more than 75% of vacation days\r\npeople show some collaborative activity, here measured by attending\r\nnon-recurring meetings, sending emails, and editing shared files.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same data also suggests what could be part of the remedy\r\nfor this unsatisfactory state of affairs. The second chart shows that\r\nthere is a small but not insignificant positive relationship between the\r\ntime that managers and their direct reports spend collaborating during\r\nvacation. The chart also shows that managers tend to collaborate more\r\nintensely during vacation than their direct reports, which is probably\r\nnot too much of a surprise.\r\n\r\nThe data is thus in line with the quite often mentioned suggestion\r\nthat managers should be better role models for their direct reports on\r\nhow to behave during vacation. As in other areas of people management,\r\nit is not enough to lay down the rules - the “playing captain” must play\r\nby those rules as well.\r\nHow are you doing in this respect?

    "contents": "\r\nSince the beginning of our efforts at Time is Ltd. to develop a\r\ncomprehensive collaboration analytics platform, we have created several\r\nhundred collaboration metrics. As you can probably imagine, with such a\r\nhuge amount of metrics, it was quite difficult for users to get\r\nsomething useful out of the platform.\r\nTo make the metrics provided more digestible, we’ve enhanced the\r\nplatform using several approaches, from simply selecting metrics with\r\nthe most straightforward call to action and creating apps for very\r\nspecific use cases to providing users with comparative, historical,\r\nintuitively scaled, and equivalent information. Brent Dykes described\r\nmany of these sense-making methods very neatly in his article Contextualized\r\nInsights: Six Ways To Put Your Numbers In Context.\r\nHowever, even after several rounds of these improvements, there was\r\nstill a need to help users quickly find areas that might be worth their\r\nattention and deeper exploration. One approach we took was based on the\r\n(validated) assumption that collaboration metrics are relatively stable\r\nover time and that the intentional and unintentional behavioral changes\r\nbehind these metrics evolve rather slowly. We therefore decided to\r\ndetect the most significant changes over the last 3 months.\r\nFor this purpose, we chose a method that is related to the Bollinger Bands\r\nmethod used in time series analysis or “Heartbeat Analysis” used in\r\nsurvey response analysis. Specifically, we look at the standard\r\ndeviation and average of the month-to-month changes for each metric,\r\nscale the changes to z-scores, and then identify the metrics with the\r\nhighest absolute value of average change over the last 3 months. To\r\nillustrate, see the attached chart where the metrics are sorted by\r\nmagnitude of their change in descending order from left to right and top\r\nto bottom.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try this method on your own data, you can use its\r\nPython implementation, which is on my\r\nGitHub page.\r\nWhat other methods do you find useful in identifying values or\r\nchanges that might be worth users’ attention? Feel free to share them in\r\nthe comments for inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nI assume many, if not all, of you are familiar with the\r\nEisenhower matrix, a simple tool for prioritizing tasks based on a\r\ncombination of their importance and urgency. It assumes 4 types of tasks\r\n- important & urgent, important & not urgent, not important\r\n& urgent, not important & not urgent - and for each of them\r\noffers a simple recommendation on what to do with them - do it, schedule\r\nit, delegate it, and delete it. By following these rules, people should\r\nbe able to more successfully combat the “mere-urgency” effect, eliminate\r\ntime-wasters in their lives, and create more space to make progress\r\ntoward their goals.\r\n\r\nSomething similar can be created also for meetings, which are big\r\ntime and money guzzlers and deserve to be treated accordingly. Only\r\ninstead of the dimensions of importance and urgency, we will use the\r\nsize and length of meetings. The resulting matrix assumes 4 types of\r\nmeetings with corresponding recommendations on what to do with them:\r\nSmall & Short: These meetings are a bit tricky\r\nbecause they often involve useful meetings, e.g., short syncs of teams\r\nworking on some specific task or project or one-on-one meetings between\r\nmanagers and their direct reports, however, when there is a lot of them,\r\nthey may cause calendar fragmentation and drop in available focus time;\r\nto avoid this, one can think of batching such meetings into larger\r\nblocks of two or three meetings with appropriate small breaks in between\r\nto avoid meeting fatigue and late arrivals.\r\nSmall & Long: These meetings are great for\r\nbrainstorming, problem-solving, or decision-making, so make sure you use\r\nthem primarily for that purpose and don’t waste them on low-value-added\r\nactivities.\r\nLarge & Short: These meetings often serve only\r\nto disseminate information and can therefore be safely replaced by less\r\nintrusive asynchronous collaboration tools such as email, instant\r\nmessaging or some kind of knowledge management tool.\r\nLarge & Long: These meetings are quite often a\r\nwaste of people’s time by not allowing everyone to meaningfully\r\ncontribute and by making them both physically and mentally exhausted, so\r\ntry to move these meetings into the third quadrant if your goal is\r\nsimple information dissemination or into the second quadrant if the goal\r\nis to solve some problem or to make some important decision.\r\nThe meeting matrix is by no means a panacea for meeting overload, but\r\nby following the rules above, people should be able to better protect\r\ntheir time for focused work and make meetings more efficient,\r\nmeaningful, and valuable for themselves and the company. Just be aware\r\nthat unlike the Eisenhower matrix, in the case of the meeting matrix,\r\npeople need to rely more on others to follow these rules in order for\r\nits positive effect to materialize. So get ready to update your\r\n(hopefully already existing) team agreement on your collaboration\r\nculture.\r\nBtw, what is your guess as to how much time you spend in each cell of\r\nthe meeting matrix? For comparison I attach my monthly numbers from\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As useful as it is to know which interventions have a\r\ndecent chance of reducing gender pay inequality, an integral part of\r\nthis fight is to regularly check the existence of this inequality across\r\nthe organisation and within different types of organisational processes.\r\nAs Alessandro\r\nLinari aptly noted in a discussion on Linkedin, “The best way to\r\nkeep the gender pay gap under control is still to do a periodic pay\r\nequity analysis across the organisation and address any identified gap.\r\nI say unfortunately because there are a thousand different ways where\r\npay differences still manage to sneak into the workforce, through hiring\r\nand promotion practices, but also retention policies, bonus allocation,\r\nperformance management, and others.” If you want to learn more\r\nabout some of the technical details of such an analysis, check out one\r\nof my previous posts on this topic (unfortunately, it is now only\r\navailable in Czech, but you can use one of the online translators to get\r\naround this limitation 😉).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For many job roles, especially\r\nknowledge-based ones, job performance has a power-law distribution,\r\ni.e., only a few percent of individuals or teams have disproportionately\r\nhigh performance and most have performance below the statistical average\r\n(many of you have probably heard of Pareto’s law, and the 80/20 rule in\r\nthis context). More detailed information on this particular topic can be\r\nfound, for example, in the following two articles - The\r\nBest and the Rest: Revisiting the Norm of Normality of Individual\r\nPerformance by O’Boyle Jr. & Aguinis (2012) and Team\r\nPerformance: Nature and Antecedents of Nonnormal Distributions by\r\nBradley & Aguinis (2022).\r\nWhy bother with that? Well, because, based on incorrect assumptions\r\nabout the distribution of specific phenomena, companies may make\r\ndecisions that ultimately harm them. For example, suppose a company\r\napplies the assumption of normal distribution in evaluating employees’\r\nperformance that actually has power law distribution. In that case, it\r\nwill result in underestimating the contribution of the best performers\r\nand overestimating the contribution of the worst performers, which may\r\nbe negatively reflected in various decisions regarding reward &\r\ncompensation, learning & development, promotions, succession\r\nplanning, etc.\r\nLessons learned? For frequent decisions or decisions with a\r\nsignificant expected impact, it is worth checking that our underlying\r\nassumptions match reality.\r\nBtw, this also applies to personal life. Here’s an example from mine:\r\nI thought I was in control of watching movies and TV shows on streaming\r\nplatforms, but I started getting signals from those around me that I was\r\nspending too much time there. So as a proper ‘Quantified Selfer’, I decided to\r\ntrack my daily screen time for a month. To my surprise, I found that I\r\nwas indeed spending a lot more time there than I thought and wished. I\r\nthen put in place simple solutions to prevent me from watching more than\r\nI should - I have started to pay extra fees into the family budget for\r\nwatching movies (loss aversion), I\r\nhave pre-selected time slots for watching movies (implementation\r\nintention), I’ve removed streaming apps from my phone (lowering salience),\r\nI’ve stopped watching movies alone (social control), and I’m also\r\nplaying with the idea of asking my wife to change the PINs (preventing\r\nimpulsive\r\nwatching).\r\nP.S. If you ever need to check the shape distribution of any of your\r\nmetrics, you should definitely try the amazing fitdistrplus\r\nR package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nWhen trying to reduce uncertainty, even very small pieces of\r\ninformation count if you are patient and have some tool to combine them\r\neffectively. I recently re-read Philip\r\nTetlock’s book Superforecasting\r\nand came across an excellent illustration of such a tool: Bayesian belief\r\nupdating.\r\n“Imagine you are sitting with your back to a billiards table. A\r\nfriend rolls a ball onto the table and it stops at a random spot. You\r\nwant to locate the ball without looking. How? Your friend rolls a second\r\nball, which stops at another random spot. You ask, “Is the second ball\r\nto the left or the right of the first?” Your friend says, “To the left.”\r\nThat’s an almost trivial scrap of information. But it’s not nothing. It\r\ntells you that the first ball is not on the extreme left edge of the\r\ntable. And it makes it just a tad more likely that the first ball is on\r\nthe right side of the table. If your friend rolls another ball on the\r\ntable and the procedure is repeated, you get another scrap of\r\ninformation. If he says, “It’s to the left,” the likelihood of the first\r\nball being on the right side of the table increases a little more. Keep\r\nrepeating the process and you slowly narrow the range of the possible\r\nlocations, zeroing in on the truth—although you will never eliminate\r\nuncertainty entirely.”\r\nAfter reading this paragraph, I thought it would be much more\r\npedagogically compelling (and fun 😉) to see this update process live\r\nand in action.

    "contents": "\r\nWhile cleaning out my (very) old computer, I came across a hidden\r\ngem: a dataset with real-world data about police cadet evaluation. It\r\nwas part of a tutorial from Peltarion, an AI\r\nsoftware company providing specialized software (Synapse) for\r\ncreating, training, evaluating, and deploying artificial neural networks\r\nand other adaptive systems (recently acquired by King). AFAIK,\r\nthis dataset is not part of any publicly available database with\r\ntraining datasets, so it may add a bit to the portfolio of possibilities\r\nfor those involved and interested in people analytics.\r\nThe data were collected as part of an effort by the National\r\nPolice Services Agency and the Dutch\r\nMinistry of Justice and Security to objectively examine whether the\r\ndata collected at the time of graduation of police cadets can be used to\r\npredict the requirements for passing the standard five-year evaluation.\r\nThe main reason for the study was to find the key indicators for the\r\nthen 20% failure rate, which was considered unacceptable (data were\r\ncollected in the late 1990s), and to study the effects of lowering\r\nadmission standards (accepting cadets with past criminal records and\r\nlowering the minimum grade from 5.5 to 4.0).\r\nThe dataset has the following characteristics:\r\n2000 observations\r\n9 attributes:\r\nAge: the age at which the cadet started studying to\r\nbecome a police officer.\r\nAvG: average grade at the time of graduation (scale\r\n1-10).\r\nChdn: number of children at the time of\r\ngraduation.\r\nExEd: extra university-level or equivalent\r\neducation (years).\r\nCR: criminal record (0=No, 1=Yes).\r\nSex: sex of the cadet (0 = Male, 1 = Female).\r\nSecE: other experience in the security sector (0 =\r\nNo, 1 = Yes).\r\nAvgE: average yearly evaluation score (The average\r\nof five years. The evaluation is performed by a committee of 10 senior\r\npolice officers. Scale 1-5). This is a help attribute and not for use as\r\ninput.\r\nFinalE: final evaluation. Fail if average yearly\r\nevaluation score (Avg) < 2.0 otherwise pass.

    "contents": "\r\nWhen correlating collaboration metrics with business criteria that\r\nour clients are interested in, such as the size of the internal network\r\nof salespeople vs. their sales performance, we often encounter the\r\nquestion of where the breakpoint is when people start to score\r\nsignificantly higher/lower on a given criterion.\r\nTo answer this question, I find very handy the Conditional\r\nInference Tree algorithm - a non-parametric class of decision trees\r\nthat, unlike traditional decision trees, use a significance/permutation\r\ntest (corrected for multiple testing) to select covariates to split and\r\nrecurse the variable.\r\nWhen applied to just one numerical predictor, it will provide a set\r\nof partitions that allow you to split that predictor into bins in such a\r\nway that you end up with statistically significant differences between\r\nsome of the identified bins. With this information in hand, it is much\r\neasier for you to find the “sweet spots” (there may be more than one)\r\nwhere the criterion starts to behave differently in relation to the\r\npredictor values.

To answer\r\nher question properly, we should avoid comparing apples with pears and\r\ncontrol for the effect of the number of collaborative activities people\r\nparticipate in, as it can be assumed that those who spend more time\r\ncollaborating with others have less time for focused work and also use\r\nthe timeboxing technique more.\r\nUsing this approach and our clients’ collaborative data, I looked at\r\nthe relationship between the proportion of work time blocked on the\r\ncalendar and the time available for focused work (i.e. no meetings, no\r\nad-hoc calls, no email or instant messaging), and found that the\r\nmarginal effect of timeboxing is in line with the positive effect of the\r\ntimeboxing technique on the time available for focused work. The effect\r\nis not huge (each percentage point of working time blocked in the\r\ncalendar yields on average .19% of focus rate), however, timeboxing\r\nseems to be saved, phew 😉\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nIn one of our projects,\r\nwhere we were trying to find out how collaborative behavior relates to\r\nemployee engagement, we repeatedly came across patterns that reminded\r\nthe client of internally well-known differences between the behavior of\r\nteams from different parts of the company. For example, we found that\r\nmore frequent participation in short and small meetings was related to\r\nlower employee engagement. This pattern matched well the client’s\r\nobservation that one particular part of the company had regular daily\r\nstand-up meetings and also lower engagement scores compared to the rest\r\nof the company due to some other aspects of their work. As further\r\nanalysis confirmed, this pattern was really just a statistical artifact\r\ncaused by the coincidence of these two facts.\r\nOne way analysts can protect themselves from this type of misleading\r\nconclusions is by using multilevel or hierarchical\r\nmodels that take into account the fact that the data\r\nhave a nested structure, i.e. that some observations are not\r\nindependent of each other because they belong to the same higher-order\r\ngroup, e.g. to an organizational unit (one of the basic assumptions of\r\nmost statistical models in use).\r\nThis is well illustrated in the graphs below. They show that the\r\nrelationship between the number of monthly 1:1s that employees have with\r\ntheir line manager and their subjectively perceived support from their\r\nline manager is slightly

the\r\nnumber of 1:1s and perceived support from the line manager (a phenomenon\r\nknown as Simpson’s\r\nparadox). In this particular case, it is relatively easy to\r\nrecognize that something may be wrong, but the situation is not always\r\nso obvious and intuitive. In these other cases, it is advantageous to\r\nhave some tool at hand to compensate for our imperfect intuition and\r\nlimited knowledge and imagination. Hierarchical models are one such\r\ntool.\r\nIf you don’t already have it in your analytics toolbox, be sure to\r\ngive it a try. If you work with R, you can use the lme4\r\nor brms\r\npackages to implement it. In a Python\r\nenvironment, you can use the statsmodels or\r\nPyMC3 libraries to\r\ndo this. And if you’re more used to drag-and-drop tools, then JASP or jamovi (both open-source alternatives\r\nto SPSS)\r\nwill give you access to various mixed models through an easy-to-use\r\ngraphical interface.\r\nFor an accessible discussion of this topic in the context of people\r\nanalytics, including other useful tools for working with hierarchical\r\ndata, see also the excellent articles by Paul van der\r\nLaken, John\r\nLipinski, and Max\r\nBlumberg:\r\nSimpson’s\r\nParadox: Two HR examples with R code.\r\nHow\r\nto Avoid Aggregation Errors and Simpson’s Paradox in HR Analytics: Part\r\n1\r\nHow\r\nto Avoid Aggregation Errors and Simpson’s Paradox in HR Analytics: Part\r\n2\r\nWhy\r\nPeople Analytics should NOT be using regression to predict team\r\noutcomes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This motivated me to look\r\nat existing research on this topic to help us better set our apriori\r\nexpectations on this issue.\r\nWith the help of metaBus, an\r\namazing platform for curating, searching, and summarizing research\r\nfindings from the social and organizational sciences, I was able to get\r\nthe results of over 100 studies on the relationship between employees’\r\nBig\r\n5 personality traits and the amount of interaction and networking\r\nbehavior they engage in. Among the criteria for the amount of\r\ninteraction were variables like contact frequency, frequency of\r\nparticipation, communication frequency, meeting frequency, hours of\r\ninteraction, interaction duration, etc. For networking behavior there\r\nwere criteria as liaison, building networks, relationship building,\r\nnetwork activity, maintaining contacts, increasing internal visibility,\r\nnetwork ability, and informal network.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# The following concepts were used to search for relevant studies on the metaBus platform (their respective codes are

There is therefore ample\r\nscope for the influence of a range of other factors.\r\nHow about you?

The greater the difference between the\r\ntwo in favor of inbound collaboration activities, the stronger the\r\nsignal that collaboration overload and/or bottlenecks may be a problem\r\nfor that team or individual.\r\nTo illustrate, take a look at the attached charts that show the\r\npatterns of collaboration between several teams via Slack. The distances\r\nbetween teams, the thickness, and the direction of the arrows between\r\nthem tell us who is collaborating with whom and how much. The size of\r\nthe nodes then represents the amount of inbound and outbound\r\ncollaborative activities that the teams participate in, respectively.\r\nBased on the differences between them, the bar chart below shows us\r\nwhere the inbound collaboration activities outweigh the outbound ones\r\nthe most, and therefore where the risk of collaboration overload and/or\r\nbottlenecks is

Do you try to always\r\nhave at least a 5-minute buffer between two consecutive meetings? And\r\nhow successful are you at this? Are you aware of situations where it is\r\nappropriate to batch meetings into tight blocks without breaks? And do\r\nyou have a limit on how many meetings to put in a row?

(You\r\ncan replicate this chart using the Google Trends website and\r\nthe search terms, time range, location, and source for searches\r\ndescribed above. If you are familiar with R, you can use the code\r\nbelow.)\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for getting data from Google Trends\r\nlibrary(gtrendsR)\r\n# uploading libraries for data manipulation\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\n\r\n# setting parameters for Google Trends\r\nsearchTerms   <- c(\"people analytics\", \"hr analytics\")\r\nlocation      <- \"\" # global\r\ntime          <- \"2007-01-01 2022-07-31\"\r\nsource         <- \"web\"\r\n\r\n# getting Google Trends data\r\ngtrendsResult <- gtrendsR::gtrends(\r\n    keyword = searchTerms, \r\n    geo     = location, \r\n    time    = time,\r\n    gprop   = source\r\n    )\r\n\r\n# cleaning data\r\ngtrendsResultDf <- gtrendsResult %>%\r\n    purrr::pluck(\"interest_over_time\") %>%\r\n    dplyr::select(date, hits, keyword) %>%\r\n    dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the time series, somewhere between September 2019\r\nand March 2020, it seems that the trend stops increasing and starts to\r\nstagnate, except for the very last part of the graph, which shows a\r\nsharp increase in searches for both terms, but this may just be the\r\nresult of the improved data collection system from January 2022 onwards\r\n(as indicated by the vertical line in the graph with a note). Thus, the\r\ndata seems to suggest the opposite of what we would expect if a pandemic\r\nwere to have a positive effect on interest in people analytics.\r\nHowever, after combining the results for the two search terms and\r\nplotting them on a graph together with the unadjusted regression trend\r\nlines, the resulting picture gives a slightly different impression.\r\nThere appears to be little to no decline in interest in people analytics\r\nimmediately after the pandemic outbreak, but a steeper slope of change\r\nafter the pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# normalize function\r\nnormalize <- function(x) {\r\n  return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\ngtrendsResultDf %>%\r\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = \"keyword\", values_from = \"hits\") %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    interestInPeopleAnalytics = `people analytics` + `hr analytics`,\r\n    interestInPeopleAnalytics = normalize(interestInPeopleAnalytics)*100\r\n  ) %>%\r\n    # creating new pandemic variable \r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    pandemic = case_when(\r\n      date >= '2020-03-01' ~ \"After the pandemic outbreak\",\r\n      TRUE ~ \"Before the pandemic outbreak\"\r\n    )\r\n  )%>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = date, y = interestInPeopleAnalytics, color = pandemic)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\", end = 0.8, name = \"\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_x_date(breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    x = \"\",\r\n    y = \"Interest in people analytics\",\r\n    title = \"Interest in people analytics before and after the pandemic outbreak\",\r\n    caption = \"The solid lines represent unadjusted regression model trend lines before and after the pandemic outbreak.\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggthemes::theme_clean() +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\r\n    legend.background = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make the picture a little bit clearer, let us take the help of\r\ninferential statistics to answer the question we are interested in. The\r\nideal analytical tool for our use case is a segmented regression\r\nanalysis of interrupted time series. It allows us to model changes in\r\nvarious processes and outcomes that follow intervention while\r\ncontrolling for the baseline level of other types of changes such as\r\ntrends and seasonality. The model used has the following general\r\nstructure:\r\n\\[Y_{t} = β_{0} + β_{1}*time_{t} +\r\nβ_{2}*intervention_{t} + β_{3}*time after intervention_{t} +\r\ne_{t}\\]\r\nThe β0 coefficient estimates the baseline level\r\nof the outcome variable at time zero; β1 coefficient\r\nestimates the change in the mean of the outcome variable that occurs\r\nwith each unit of time before the intervention (i.e. the baseline\r\ntrend); β2 coefficient estimates the level change in\r\nthe mean of the outcome variable immediately after the intervention\r\n(i.e. from the end of the preceding segment); and β3\r\nestimates the change in the trend in the mean of the outcome variable\r\nper unit of time after the intervention, compared with the trend before\r\nthe intervention (thus, the sum of β1 and\r\nβ3 equals to the post-intervention slope).\r\nSince we are dealing with correlated and truncated data, we should\r\nalso include two additional terms in our model, an autocorrelation term\r\nand a truncation term, to handle these specific properties of our\r\ndata.\r\nData preparation\r\nBut first, let’s prepare the data we will need for this type of\r\nanalysis. Specifically, we will need the following five variables:\r\nsearch interest in people analytics – numerical\r\nvariable representing search interest in people analytics relative to\r\nthe highest point on the chart for the given region and time; this\r\nvariable is truncated within the interval between values of 0 and 100; a\r\nvalue of 100 is the peak popularity for the term; a value of 50 means\r\nthat the term is half as popular; a score of 0 means that there was not\r\nenough data for this term; search interest for two monitored terms\r\n(“people analytics” and “HR analytics”) was combined by simple summation\r\nand then normalized to a range of 0 to 100; this variable serves as a\r\ndependent (criterion) variable;\r\nelapsed time – numerical variable representing the\r\nnumber of months that elapsed from the beginning of the time series;\r\nthis variable enables estimation of the size and direction of the\r\noverall trend in the data before the intervention;\r\npandemic – dichotomic variable indicating the\r\npresence/absence of pandemic; as already mentioned above, for the\r\npurpose of this analysis, the beginning of the pandemic is assumed to\r\nhave started in March 2020; this variable enables estimation of the\r\nlevel change in the interest in people analytics immediately after the\r\npandemic outbreak;\r\nelapsed time after pandemic outbreak – numerical\r\nvariable representing the number of months that elapsed from the\r\nbeginning of pandemic; this variable enables estimation of the change in\r\nthe trend in the interest in people analytics after the outbreak of\r\npandemic;\r\nmonth – categorical variable representing specific\r\nmonth within a year; this variable enables controlling for the effect of\r\nseasonality.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# munging data\r\nmydata <- gtrendsResultDf %>%\r\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = \"keyword\", values_from = \"hits\") %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n

For this\r\nreason, we must also specify some additional parameters\r\n(e.g. chains, iter or warmup) of\r\nthe\r\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that generates posterior\r\nsamples of our model’s parameters.\r\nThe Bayesian framework also allows us to specify priors for the\r\nestimated parameters and use them to incorporate our domain knowledge\r\ninto the analysis. The specified priors are important for both parameter\r\nestimation and hypothesis testing because they define our initial\r\ninformation state before we consider our data. Here, we will use\r\nrelatively broad, uninformative, and only slightly regularizing priors\r\n(that is, the inference results will be very close to the results of\r\nstandard, frequentist parameter estimation/hypothesis testing).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for Bayesian statistical inference\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\r\n\r\n# checking available priors for the models \r\nbrms::get_prior(\r\n  interestInPeopleAnalytics | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = mydata,\r\n  family = gaussian())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# specifying wide, uninformative, and only mildly regularizing priors \r\npriors <- c(brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"elapsedTime\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"elapsedTimeAfterPandemic\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthApr\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthAug\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthDec\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthFeb\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthJul\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthJun\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthMar\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthMay\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthNov\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthOct\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthSep\"))\r\n\r\n# defining the statistical model\r\nmodel <- brms::brm(\r\n  interestInPeopleAnalytics | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = mydata,\r\n  family = gaussian(),\r\n  prior = priors,\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  iter = 20000,\r\n  warmup = 2000,\r\n  seed = 1234,\r\n  sample_prior = TRUE, \r\n  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.9),\r\n  backend = \"cmdstanr\",\r\n  refresh = 0,\r\n  silent = 2 \r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore making any inferences, we should perform several validation\r\nchecks to ensure that the mechanics of the MCMC algorithm worked well\r\nand that we can use the generated posterior samples to make inferences\r\nabout the parameters of our model. There are many ways to do this, but\r\nhere we will only use a visual check of the MCMC chains. We want the\r\nplots of these chains to look like a hairy caterpillar, indicating the\r\nconvergence of the underlying Markov chain to stationarity and the\r\nconvergence of the Monte Carlo estimates to population quantities,\r\nrespectively. As can be seen in the graph below, we can observe the\r\ncharacteristics we are looking for in the MCMC chains described above.\r\n(For additional MCMC diagnostics procedures, see for example Bayesian\r\nNotes from Jeffrey B. Arnold.)\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for plotting Bayesian models\r\nlibrary(bayesplot)\r\n\r\n# plotting the MCMC chains\r\nbayesplot::mcmc_trace(\r\n  model,\r\n  facet_args = list(nrow = 6)\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Plots of the MCMC chains used for estimation of the model parameters\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\", end = 0.8, name = \"\") +\r\n  ggthemes::theme_clean() +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\r\n    legend.background = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also important to check how well the model fits the data.

Thus, this suggests that immediately after\r\nthe pandemic outbreak, interest in people analysis declined slightly\r\n(somewhere between ~1 and ~20 points, as indicated by the 95% credible\r\ninterval).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for working with output from Bayesian models\r\nlibrary(tidybayes)\r\n\r\nparamVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak <- model %>%\r\n  tidybayes::gather_draws(b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(value = .value)\r\n\r\ndens <- density(paramVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak$value)\r\n\r\nparamVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak <- tibble::tibble(x = dens$x, y = dens$y)\r\n\r\n# visualizing the posterior distribution of the model's b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter \r\nggplot2::ggplot(paramVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak, aes(x,y)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_area(data = filter(paramVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak, x > 0), fill = \"#fca636\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_area(data = filter(paramVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak, x <= 0), fill = \"grey\") +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Posterior distribution of the pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter\",\r\n    y = \"Density\",\r\n    x = \"pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\"\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggthemes::theme_clean()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for working with output from Bayesian models\r\nlibrary(posterior)\r\n\r\n# extracting posterior samples\r\nsamplesBeforethepandemicoutbreak <- posterior::as_draws_df(model, seed = 1234)\r\n\r\n# probability of b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak coefficient being higher than 0\r\nsum(samplesBeforethepandemicoutbreak$b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak > 0) / nrow(samplesBeforethepandemicoutbreak)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.9874167\r\n\r\nNow let’s check the second key parameter of our model, the time after\r\nthe pandemic term. In this case, the posterior distribution is again on\r\nthe right-hand side of zero value, but now this result is consistent\r\nwith the claim that there is a positive effect of the pandemic on\r\npeople’s interest in people analytics, specifically in terms of the\r\nchange in slope after the pandemic. Compared to the pre-pandemic trend,\r\nthe post-pandemic trend is steeper by ~0 to ~1 point per month (as\r\nindicated by the 95% confidence interval). We should bear in mind,\r\nhowever, that this effect may in fact only be an artifact caused by the\r\nimproved data collection system from January 2022, as mentioned at the\r\nvery beginning of this post.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nparamVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic <- model %>%\r\n  tidybayes::gather_draws(b_elapsedTimeAfterPandemic) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(value = .value)\r\n\r\ndens <- density(paramVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic$value)\r\n\r\nparamVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic <- tibble::tibble(x = dens$x, y = dens$y)\r\n\r\n# visualizing the posterior distribution of the model's b_elapsedTimeAfterPandemic parameter \r\nggplot2::ggplot(paramVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic, aes(x,y)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_area(data = filter(paramVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic, x > 0), fill = \"#fca636\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_area(data = filter(paramVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic, x <= 0), fill = \"grey\") +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Posterior distribution of the elapsedTimeAfterPandemic parameter\",\r\n    y = \"Density\",\r\n    x = \"elapsedTimeAfterPandemic\"\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggthemes::theme_clean()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# extracting posterior samples\r\nsamplesElapsedTimeAfterPandemic <- posterior::as_draws_df(model, seed = 1234)\r\n\r\n# probability of b_elapsedTimeAfterPandemic coefficient being higher than 0\r\nsum(samplesElapsedTimeAfterPandemic$b_elapsedTimeAfterPandemic > 0) / nrow(samplesElapsedTimeAfterPandemic)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.9927639\r\n\r\nThe overall resulting picture thus partially supports the impression\r\nof many of my people analytics fellows about the growing importance of\r\npeople analytics in HR and business leaders’ decision making. However,\r\ngiven that the Google search interest in people analytics is a fairly\r\ndistant proxy for its actual use in HR and business practice, we should\r\ntake these results with a grain of salt and try to find other data\r\nsources that would support our results. For example, Frank Corrigan, head of\r\nanalytics at Ponder, came up with the idea of analyzing changes in\r\npostings for people analytics job positions over time. A good\r\ninspiration for anyone willing to spend some time getting at and\r\nanalyzing such data.\r\nIn addition to the main question addressed here, we may be interested\r\nin other insights provided by the model. To this end, we can plot the\r\nmarginal effect of each predictor. Beyond what we already know, we can\r\nsee that search interest in people analytics has clearly trended upwards\r\nover the last 15 years, and within each year, search interest follows\r\nthe seasonality of work and holidays, i.e., search interest is lower\r\nduring the holiday season - June, July, August and December - and higher\r\nthroughout the rest of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# plotting marginal effect of predictors used \r\nfigList <- plot(brms::marginal_effects(model, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)), theme = ggthemes::theme_clean(), ask = FALSE) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for arranging multiple ggplots\r\nlibrary(ggpubr)\r\n\r\n# putting all graphs with marginal effects together  \r\nggpubr::ggarrange(\r\n  plotlist = list(figList[[1]] + geom_line(color = \"#0d1687\", size = 1), figList[[4]] + geom_point(color = \"#0d1687\", size = 3), figList[[2]] + geom_point(color = \"#0d1687\", size = 3), figList[[3]] + geom_line(color = \"#0d1687\", size = 1)), \r\n  nrow = 4\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  ggpubr::annotate_figure(\r\n    top = text_grob(\"Marginal effect of predictors used\"),\r\n    bottom = text_grob(\"Point estimates are shown along with 95% credible intervals.\", hjust = 1, x = 1, face = \"italic\", size = 10)\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The chosen task was to analyze the effectiveness of\r\nrecruiting sources for a company that plans to double in size\r\nfrom its current 750+ employees.\r\nAlthough the dummy data provided was quite limited for obvious\r\nreasons and did not allow to answer all relevant questions (but you\r\ncould also use your own data which would not suffer from this\r\nshortcoming), after combining them and enriching them slightly based on\r\nrealistic assumptions, it was possible to arrive at quite interesting\r\ninsights and recommendations.

Not only is it a valid alternative\r\nto standard statistical inference, but as a by-product it helps with\r\nbuilding intuition about the\r\ndifference between signal and noise.\r\nThe basis of the method is a so-called lineup\r\nprotocol that places a graph of the actual data between arrays\r\nof graphs of null data that are generated by a method consistent with\r\nthe null hypothesis. The lineup is shown to one or more observers who\r\nare asked to identify the graph that differs. If an observer can pick\r\nout the actual data as different from the others, this gives weight to\r\nthe statistical significance of the pattern in the graph.\r\nBecause people usually have a hard time recognizing randomness and\r\ntend to see patterns even where there are none, there is also a\r\nso-called Rorschach protocol that only displays graphs\r\ncreated with null datasets and which is used by observers to calibrate\r\ntheir eyes for variation due to sampling.\r\nYou can try it for yourself in the graphs below, which show the\r\nrelationship between two variables from my current area of work\r\n(collaboration\r\nanalytics), namely between time\r\navailable for focused work and the use of timeboxing\r\n(productivity enhancing technique of assigning a fixed unit of time to\r\nan activity within which a planned activity takes place).\r\nUse the first array of graphs (the Rorschach protocol) to calibrate\r\nyour eye for randomness and then try to identify the actual data in the\r\nsecond array of graphs (the lineup protocol). What’s your guess? Which\r\ngraph matches the actual data (1-20) and what relationship do you see in\r\nthe data? You can give your guess in the comments.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(nullabor)\r\nlibrary(patchwork)\r\nlibrary(scales)\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\nmydata <- readRDS(\"./visualInferenceData.RDS\")\r\n\r\n# lineup protocol\r\nset.seed(1234)\r\nd <- lineup(null_permute(\"propBlockedTime\"), mydata)\r\n\r\nlplot <- ggplot(data=d, aes(x = focusRate, y = propBlockedTime)) + \r\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1) + \r\n  facet_wrap(~ .sample) +\r\n  labs(\r\n    title = \"LINEUP PROTOCOL\",\r\n    x = \"FOCUS RATE\",\r\n    y = \"PROPORTION OF BLOCKED WORKING TIME\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(suffix = \"%\")) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rorschach protocol\r\ndr <- rorschach(null_permute(\"propBlockedTime\"), mydata, n = 20, p = 0)\r\n\r\nrplot <- ggplot(data=dr, aes(x = focusRate, y = propBlockedTime)) + \r\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1) + \r\n  facet_wrap(~ .sample) +\r\n  labs(\r\n    title = \"RORSCHACH PROTOCOL\",\r\n    x = \"FOCUS RATE\",\r\n    y = \"PROPORTION OF BLOCKED WORKING TIME\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(suffix = \"%\")) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())\r\n\r\n# combining plots\r\nfplot <- rplot / lplot\r\n\r\nprint(fplot)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s a check on your guess.

As you can see in the summary\r\ntables and charts below, the null value is safely outside the 95%\r\ncredible interval of the mean of the focus rate parameter, and the\r\nmarginal effect of focus rate clearly shows its negative relationship\r\nwith the predicted proportion of working time blocked in the calendar.\r\nNote also that the relationship is non-linear, i.e. the marginal effect\r\nof the focus rate is different depending on its level.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\nlibrary(bayesplot)\r\nlibrary(tidybayes) \r\nlibrary(ggdist)       \r\n\r\n# fitting Bayesian beta regression model\r\nmodel <- brms::brm(\r\n  bf(\r\n    propBlockedTime ~ focusRate,\r\n    phi ~ focusRate\r\n    ),\r\n  data=mydata,\r\n  family= Beta(),\r\n  seed = 1234,\r\n  iter = 20000,\r\n  warmup = 2000,\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  cores = 6,\r\n  control = list(\r\n    adapt_delta = 0.9,\r\n    max_treedepth = 20\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# summary of the fitted model\r\nsummary(model)\r\n\r\n\r\n Family: beta \r\n  Links: mu = logit; phi = log \r\nFormula: propBlockedTime ~ focusRate \r\n         phi ~ focusRate\r\n   Data: mydata (Number of observations: 306) \r\n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 20000; warmup = 2000; thin = 1;\r\n         total post-warmup draws = 72000\r\n\r\nPopulation-Level Effects: \r\n              Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS\r\nIntercept        -0.85      0.25    -1.33    -0.35 1.00    61653\r\nphi_Intercept     2.09      0.39     1.30     2.84 1.00    59323\r\nfocusRate        -0.02      0.00    -0.03    -0.02 1.00    57209\r\nphi_focusRate     0.01      0.01    -0.01     0.02 1.00    56423\r\n              Tail_ESS\r\nIntercept        54084\r\nphi_Intercept    51459\r\nfocusRate        55167\r\nphi_focusRate    51573\r\n\r\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

As you can see, there is little difference between the two groups in terms of the average daily amount of time people spend by collaboration over the last six months (see the density plots), but there is a fairly clear difference in the trend of this metric over the same period, suggesting that less satisfied employees may be suffering from increasing collaboration overload (see the line charts with trend lines for individual employees and the estimated overall linear trend).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have a similar experience with or just a strong hunch about other metrics in your area of expertise?

As in other activities, even here the well-known Parkinson’s rule applies that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” When this is combined with the automatic use of default meeting lengths, it leads to spending more time in meetings than is necessary.\r\nFor this reason, Steven Rogelberg suggests in his book The Surprising Science of Meetings that all meeting times should be reduced by 5-10 percent by default.\r\nTo assess whether you have room for improvement in this regard, it is useful to compare actual and planned meeting lengths. For illustration, the attached chart shows the distribution of the typical differences between actual and planned meeting lengths for each of our teams organizing online meetings over the course of a year. It clearly shows that a large proportion of teams are organizing meetings longer than necessary, by an average of 4 minutes.

    "contents": "\r\nOne of the advantages of switch to remote working is that companies\r\ncan expand the pool of talent from which they choose their employees,\r\nwithout being too constrained by country or even continental boundaries.\r\nHowever, the resulting cultural diversity can bring not only positive\r\neffects (e.g. a broader set of perspectives, a more diverse skill base,\r\nlocal market knowledge and insight, better creativity and innovation,\r\netc.) but also some challenges (e.g. risk of prejudice or negative\r\ncultural stereotypes, misinterpretation of communication, conflicting\r\nwork styles, different understanding of professional etiquette,\r\netc.).\r\nBetter knowledge and awareness of the cultural specificities of the\r\nsocieties from which people come is one way\r\nof dealing with these challenges. In this respect, Hofstede’s\r\ntheory of cultural dimensions may be useful to us. Just as\r\nBig-5\r\ntheory facilitates our understanding of other people’s\r\npersonalities, Hofstede’s theory facilitates our understanding of their\r\ncultural background by describing their social values and releated\r\nbehaviors through the following six cultural dimensions:\r\n Image source:\r\nhttps://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/hofstedes-cultural-dimensions-theory/\r\nYou can easily check how countries are doing on these six dimensions\r\non the\r\nHofstede Insights website. To make it easier to compare cultural\r\ndifferences/similarities between countries, I built a simple app that\r\nprojects the cultural profiles of countries into 2D space using\r\ndimensionality reduction technique called UMAP\r\n(Uniform manifold approximation and projection). By selecting a\r\nspecific cultural dimension, you can see how it is distributed across\r\ncountries and continents. In addition, you can select some specific\r\ncountries in the comparator and compare them across all six cultural\r\ndimensions.\r\nCheck it out here ➡️ https://peopleanalyticsblog.shinyapps.io/Hofstede_Cultural_Dimensions/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

[By]\r\ndefault you change what you’re doing every hour. But [makers] generally\r\nprefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or\r\nprogram well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get\r\nstarted. When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a\r\ndisaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it\r\ninto two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to\r\nremember to go to the meeting.\r\nI recently realized that I have only seen illustrative pictures on\r\nthis topic so far, but not any real data. This inspired me to look at\r\nour own collaboration data at Time\r\nIs Ltd. and see if these two schedule categories can be found\r\nthere.\r\nWhen I contrasted the data on the average number of meetings per day\r\nand the average time between meetings, there were indeed categories of\r\npeople who either have relatively more meetings with relatively shorter\r\nbreaks (managers), or have relatively fewer meetings with\r\nrelatively longer breaks (makers).\r\n\r\nBut beyond that, there was a third type, which I called\r\nbatchers - they have relatively fewer meetings with relatively\r\nshorter breaks, which is a good strategy when you have to be both\r\nmanager and creator, which may be the case for more and more people as\r\nwe move to remote working.\r\nIn the charts below you can see how typical monthly calendars of\r\nthese three types of schedulers look like.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we cannot see in our own data, but could theoretically be there,\r\nis a fourth category I call overtimers, who have relatively\r\nmore meetings but manage to keep relatively longer breaks in between.\r\nHowever, this can only be achieved by making the meetings more spread\r\nout over time, i.e. at the cost of working after hours.\r\nHow about you? Where would you fit in? And is there anyone among you\r\nwho would fit into the fourth, missing category?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Still, I think you may find some of the statistics\r\nuseful, or at least interesting and entertaining.\r\nYou can take it as a kind of Christmas gift for my fellow LinkedIn\r\nusers. Enjoy exploring your connections! And if you’d like to explore\r\nand better manage also your company’s internal collaboration networks,\r\nthen check out what we do at Time\r\nis Ltd.\r\nP.S. The data you upload is not permanently stored anywhere. The app\r\nruns on the shinyapps.io server.\r\nIf you don’t want to upload your own data, but would still like to see\r\nwhat the analysis output looks like, you can download and then upload\r\nready-made sample data from the app.\r\nP.P.S.

pro nevyváženost příjmů žen a mužů pravděpodobně existuje\r\nvětší množství. Mezi nejčastěji uváděné důvody patří:\r\nDiskriminace na pracovišti. Stejné práce je\r\nodměňována rozdílně čistě na základě pohlaví pracovníka.\r\nGenderové stereotypy. Předsudky ohledně výkonnosti,\r\nschopností a vlastností žen mají za následek oslabení jejich pozic a\r\nvytváření tzv. „skleněného stropu“, tj. neviditelné bariéry, na kterou\r\nženy naráží při snaze o kariérní postup na lépe placené pozice.\r\nSegregace trhu. Odvětví, v nichž je tradičně\r\nzaměstnáváno více žen než mužů jako je zdravotnictví, školství nebo\r\nveřejná správa, jsou společností vnímána jako méně prestižní, a tedy i\r\nhůře odměňována.\r\nRodinný život. Ženy většinou nesou větší část\r\nzátěže spojené s rodinným životem (např. při odchodu na mateřskou\r\ndovolenou, při péči o nemocné děti či jiné členy domácnosti), což jim\r\nvýznamně stěžuje jejich snahu o kariérní růst.\r\nV situaci, kdy při reportování GPG nerozlišujeme mezi různými důvody\r\npro platovou nerovnost, hovoříme o tzv. neadjustované\r\nGPG. Pro potřeby firemního auditu platové nerovnosti je však\r\ndůležité zjistit rovněž tzv. adjustovanou GPG, která se\r\nsnaží vyjádřit míru platové nerovnosti, která je způsobena čistě\r\npohlavím zaměstnance. Zatímco adjustovaná GPG umožňuje firmě\r\nidentifikovat možnou diskriminaci na pracovišti, neadjustovaná GPG (při\r\nneprokázané adjustované GPG) může poukazovat na existenci problémů jako\r\njsou genderové stereotypy či nedostatečná podpora žen při snaze skloubit\r\nsvůj osobní a profesní život. Pro firmy je tak užitečné sledovat oba\r\nukazatele.\r\nProč se\r\nzabývat platovou nerovností ve Vaší firmě?\r\nI kdybychom odhlédli od etických či právních aspektů platové\r\nnerovnosti mezi muži a ženami, je ve velice pragmatickém zájmu každé\r\nfirmy, aby se tento druh nespravedlnosti v jejím systému odměňování\r\nnevyskytoval. V době sociálních sítí a platforem na hodnocení firem\r\njejich současnými i bývalými zaměstnanci (za všechny zmiňme např. Glassdoor nebo\r\nčeský Atmoskop) se totiž\r\ninformace o nerovném přístupu může velice snadno rozšířit mezi\r\npotenciální i stávající zaměstnance, kteří ji mohou zohlednit při svém\r\nrozhodování, zda se v dané firmě ucházet o práci, resp. zda v ní i\r\nnadále zůstat.\r\nTuto skutečnost dokládají např. výsledky průzkumu\r\nprovedeného společností Glassdoor, podle kterého cca 67 % (U.S.)\r\nzaměstnanců by se neucházelo o práci tam, kde by si myslelo, že muži a\r\nženy mají nerovné platové podmínky.\r\nAudit platové\r\nnerovnosti mezi muži a ženami\r\nStejně jako při řešení jakéhokoli jiného problému, i v tomto případě\r\nplatí, že v první řadě je především potřeba ověřit, že nějaký\r\nproblém k řešení vůbec existuje. K tomu poslouží\r\nfiremní audit platové nerovnosti mezi muži a ženami.\r\nTen prostřednictvím analýzy platových, demografických a organizačních\r\ndat ověří, zda máme nějaké doklady pro to, že v dané společnosti\r\nexistují platové rozdíly mezi zaměstnanci spojené s jejich pohlavím.\r\nTeprve na základě výsledků takové analýzy je možné se začít poohlížet po\r\nmožných opatřeních v oblastech náboru, odměňování a/nebo povyšování,\r\nkterá by mohla pomoct nespravedlivé platové nerovnosti odstranit nebo\r\nalespoň zmírnit.\r\nNíže uvedený příklad takového auditu vychází z článku How\r\nto Analyze Your Gender Pay Gap: An Employer’s Guide od Andrew\r\nChamberlaina, Ph.D., hlavního ekonoma a vedoucího výzkumu ve\r\nspolečnosti Glassdoor.\r\nPlán analýzy\r\nAnalýzu platové nerovnosti mezi muži a ženami provedeme v\r\nnásledujících několika krocích:\r\nNačteme si data, která obsahují informace o platech vzorku\r\nzaměstnanců, jejich pohlaví, demografických a organizačních\r\ncharakteristikách, na kterých budeme testovat naše hypotézy. Za tímto\r\núčelem použijeme ilustrační data\r\nposkytnutá společností Glassdoor.\r\nV případě potřeby si upravíme data tak, aby lépe vyhovovala potřebám\r\nnaší analýzy.\r\nProvedeme explorační analýzu, která nám poskytne základní představu\r\no našich datech.\r\nSpočítáme si neadjustovanou GPG.\r\nS pomocí hierarchické regresní analýzy vytvoříme statistický model\r\nGPG, který nám umožní lépe rozlišit “vliv” různých faktorů, včetně\r\njejich interakcí, na pozorované rozdíly v platech mužů a žen.\r\nOvěříme, zda samotné pohlaví zaměstance - při zohlednění “vlivu”\r\nostatních faktorů, ke kterým máme k dispozici nějaká data - hraje\r\nnějakou významnější roli ve výši platu, který zaměstnanec dostává.\r\nOvěříme, zda pohlaví zaměstnance neinteraguje s některými dalšími\r\nfaktory při predikci výše jejich mzdy.\r\nDostupná data\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ndata <- readr::read_csv(\"./GenderPay_Data.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nK dispozici máme následující data ke vzorku 1000

Rychlý přehled o\r\nněkterých těchto vztazích nám může poskytnout níže uvedený graf, který\r\nzobrazuje souvislosti mezi jednotlivými dvojicemi proměnných a s pomocí\r\nbarevného kódování navíc nese informaci o tom, jak se tyto souvislosti\r\nliší mezi pohlavími. V grafu můžeme např. vidět, že se v případě\r\nněkterých pracovních pozic významně liší relativní zastoupení mužů a\r\nžen. V menší míře se zdá tento rozdíl platit i v případě úrovně\r\nvzdělání. Určitý rozdíl mezi muži a ženami se zdá existovat rovněž ve\r\nvýši jejich základní mzdy (narozdíl od bonusové složky, která se zdá být\r\nu mužů a žen obdobně vysoká).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nGGally::ggpairs(mydata, aes(color = gender, alpha = 0.4)) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n      strip.text.x = element_text(\r\n        size = 22),\r\n      strip.text.y = element_text(\r\n        size = 22)\r\n      ) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2:: scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVizuální dojem o rozdílné výši základní mzdy u mužů a žen potvrzuje i\r\ndetailnější analýza tohoto rozdílu. Ta ukazuje, že v našem vzorku\r\nmediánová mzda žen činí 89913.5 USD a mediánová mzda mužů 98223 USD. To\r\nodpovídá rozdílu 8309.5 USD, resp. neadjustované GPG (definované jako\r\npoměr rozdílu mediánové mzdy mužů a žen a mediánové mzdy mužů) 8.5 %.\r\nMíra platové nerovnosti se tak v námi sledované firmě zdá být spíše\r\nnižší, srovnatelná s celkovou hodnotou tohoto ukazatele v zemích jako je\r\nnapř. Švédsko nebo Nový Zéland (viz graf z úvodu tohoto článku).\r\nPokud bychom chtěli zohlednit míru naší nejistoty při odhadu\r\nvelikosti rozdílu mezi typickým platem mužů a žen, která je daná tím, že\r\npracujeme pouze se vzorkem zaměstnanců a nikoli s celou firmou, měli\r\nbychom sáhnout po inferenční statistice. Při použití bayesovského\r\nekvivalentu t-testu pro dva nezávislé výběry získáme takto informaci o\r\nposteriorní distribuci velikosti tohoto rozdílu. Na grafu níže můžeme\r\nvidět, že 95% interval kredibility se nachází v rozmezí od 5511 do 11615\r\nUSD, s mediánovou hodnotou 8392 USD.

Pozorovaný rozdíl může být totiž např. způsobený tím, že\r\nženy zaměstnané v námi sledované firmě mají typicky nižší vzdělání než\r\nve stejné firmě zaměstnaní muži. A vzhledem k tomu, že výše vzdělání (z\r\nhlediska “meritokratické spravedlnosti” zcela neproblematicky) pozitivně\r\nkoreluje s výší platu, projeví se tato souvislost v nižší typické mzdě\r\nžen (ponechme nyní stranou otázku, v jaké míře mají ženy obecně přístup\r\nk vyššímu vzdělání ve společnosti, kde daná firma působí). Tuto hypotézu\r\nse zdají podporovat i dva níže uvedené grafy, které vizualizují vztah\r\nmezi úrovní vzdělání zaměstnance a výší jeho základní mzdy, resp.\r\nsouvislost mezi pohlavím zaměstnance a úrovní jeho vzdělání.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmydata %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = edu, y = basePay)) +\r\n  PupillometryR::geom_flat_violin(position = position_nudge(x = .2, y = 0), alpha = .8, fill = \"#a9b2d1\") +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point(aes(y = basePay), position = position_jitter(width = .15), size = .5, alpha = 0.8, color = \"#a9b2d1\") +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_boxplot(width = .1, guides = FALSE, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.5, fill = \"#a9b2d1\") +\r\n  ggplot2::expand_limits(x = 5.25) +\r\n  ggplot2::guides(fill = FALSE) +\r\n  ggplot2::guides(color = FALSE) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(\r\n    labels = scales::number_format(\r\n      accuracy = 1,\r\n      scale = 1/1000,\r\n      suffix = \"k\",\r\n      prefix = \"$\",\r\n      ),\r\n    limits = c(0,200000)\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(title = \"Vztah mezi úrovní vzdělání a výší základní mzdy\",\r\n       x = \"\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmydata %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = edu, fill = gender)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_hue() +\r\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(title = \"Míra zastoupení můžů a žen v jednotlivých kategoriích úrovně vzdělání\",\r\n                x = \"\",\r\n                y = \"\",\r\n                fill = \"\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2:: scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"top\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPodobných kombinovaných souvislostí může v našich datech (a v\r\nrealitě, kterou reprezentují) existovat větší množství. Pokud by čtenář\r\nchtěl vztahy mezi různými kombinacemi proměnných prozkoumat sám a\r\ndetailněji, může za tímto účelem využít tuto\r\ninteraktivní aplikaci, kde jsou nahraná naše data a kde lze snadno\r\nrůzným způsobem vizualizovat zadané kombinace proměnných. Viz níže\r\nuvedená ukázka využití této aplikace při vizualizaci vztahu mezi výší\r\nplatu, pohlavím a pracovní pozicí, včetně počtu zaměstnanců v\r\njednotlivých kombinovaných kategoriích. Z tohoto konkrétního grafu je\r\ndobře patrné, že ženy jsou ve srovnání s muži disproporčně méně\r\nzastoupeny na dvou nadprůměrně odměňovaných pozicích Manager a\r\nSoftware Engineer a naopak disproporčně více jsou zastoupeny na\r\npodprůměrně platově ohodnocené pozici Marketing Associate.\r\n\r\n Důležitou kategorií vztahů mezi proměnnými, kterou bychom měli\r\nprozkoumat, pokud se chceme co nejblíže dostat k příčinám pozorovaných\r\nnerovností v platech mužů a žen a dobře zacílit případné intervence,\r\njsou tzv. interakce. Ty popisují situace, kdy vztah\r\nmezi dvěma proměnnými závisí na hodnotě nějaké třetí proměnné. Nás zde\r\nbude konkrétně zajímat interakce mezi naší hlavní nezávislou proměnnou\r\n(prediktorem), tj. pohlavím zaměstnance, a dalšími nezávislými\r\nproměnnými (např. věkem, úrovní vzdělání, hodnocením pracovního výkonu,\r\npracovní pozicí nebo oddělením) ve vztahu k naší závislé proměnné\r\n(kritériu), tedy základní mzdě.\r\nPříkladem vizualizace tohoto druhu vztahu mezi proměnnými je níže\r\nuvedený graf, ze kterého můžeme vyčíst, že ženy mají sice v průměru\r\nnižší základní mzdu než muži napříč celým věkovým spektrem (viz níže\r\npoložená regresní přímka pro skupinu žen), ale fakt, že zobrazené\r\nregresní přímky jsou rovnoběžné, svědčí pro to, že v rámci obou skupin\r\nplatí stejný typ vztahu mezi věkem a výší platu, a tedy že mezi pohlavím\r\na věkem ve vztahu k výši mzdy nedochází k žádné interakci. Pokud by se\r\nexistence takové interakce potvrdila i při zohlednění dalších\r\nrelevantních faktorů, mělo by to pro nás být podnětem k další exploraci\r\ntoho, co se pozorovaným rozdílem skrývá.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmydata %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = age, y = basePay, fill = gender, colour = gender, group = gender)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point(size = 1L, position = \"jitter\", alpha = 0.5) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_smooth(span = 1L, method = \"lm\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(title = \"Vztah mezi věkem zaměstnanců a výší jejich základní mzdy\",\r\n                fill = \"\",\r\n                color = \"\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(\r\n    labels = scales::number_format(\r\n      accuracy = 1,\r\n      scale = 1/1000,\r\n      suffix = \"k\",\r\n      prefix = \"$\",\r\n      big.mark = \",\"),\r\n    limits = c(0,200000)\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"top\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatistický model platové\r\nnerovnosti\r\nAbychom dokázali izolovat vliv samotného pohlaví zaměstnanců na výši\r\nplatu a zohlednit přitom zároveň vliv všech ostatních relevantních\r\nfaktorů, včetně některých jejich interakcí, musíme sáhnout po\r\nkomplexnějším nástroji než je popisná statistika. A tímto nástrojem je\r\nstatistické modelování.\r\nStatistické modelování, podobně jako jakékoli jiné modelování ve\r\nvědě, ale i v běžném životě, není ničím jiným než snahou\r\nvytvořit menší a zjednodušený model našeho světa, který však\r\njeho chování odráží dostatečně věrně na to, abychom s jeho pomocí mohli\r\nčinit úsudky a předpovědi o skutečném světě a zakládat na něm svá\r\nrozhodnutí (k tomuto tématu viz srozumitelně napsaný\r\npopularizující článek Modeluji,\r\ntedy jsem od Josefa Šlerky).\r\nStatistické modelování se potom od jiných druhů modelování liší v tom,\r\nže se ve větší míře opírá o nástroje matematické statistiky a teorie\r\npravděpodobnosti.\r\nPřekvapivě mnoho jevů našeho světa se dá úspěšně modelovat a\r\npředpovídat pomocí relativně jednoduchých statistických modelů\r\nzobecněné lineární regrese (Generalized Linear\r\nModels, GLM). Ty předpokládají, že závislá proměnná, transformovaná\r\nprostřednictvím tzv. linkovací funkce (link\r\nfunction), je funkcí lineární kombinace nezávislých proměnných.\r\nNejznámější z této rodiny statistických modelů je klasický\r\nlineární model, který předpokládá normální rozdělení závislé\r\nproměnné, resp. reziduí (chyb) okolo predikované/ očekávané střední\r\nhodnoty závislé proměnné (viz ilustrativní obrázek níže).\r\n\r\nVzhledem k tomu, že námi modelovaná proměnná základní mzdy se zdá mít\r\nnormální, nebo téměř normální rozdělení (viz některé grafy v části\r\nvěnované explorační analýze), můžeme i my sáhnout po tomto statistickém\r\nmodelu. Jako nezávislé proměnné v našem modelu použijeme všechny nám\r\ndostupné prediktory, spolu s interakcemi mezi proměnnou pohlaví na\r\nstraně jedné a proměnnými úrovně vzdělání, seniority, věku a hodnocení\r\npracovního výkonu na straně druhé. Protože zaměstnanci tvoří přirozené\r\nshluky v rámci oddělení, napříč kterými se liší výše mzdy a také by se\r\nmohla lišit povaha vztahu mezi pohlavím zaměstnance a výší jeho mzdy,\r\npoužijeme hierarchickou/víceúrovňovou variantu modelu lineární\r\nregrese, která umožňuje, aby hodnoty vybraných parametrů modelu\r\nvariovaly v závilosti na příslušnosti zaměstnanců do konkrétního\r\noddělení.\r\nK odhadu hodnot parametrů našeho modelu použijeme inferenční\r\nrámec bayesovské statistiky, která ve srovnání s\r\nfrekventistickou statistikou nabízí bohatší a intuitivně snáze\r\nuchopitelné výstupy. Pro apriorní distribuci parametrů modelu použijeme\r\ndefaultní, široké a neinformativní hodnoty, takže výsledky analýzy budou\r\nnominálně podobné těm, které bychom získali při použití tradičnější\r\nfrekventistické inferenční statistiky.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# defining and running the model\r\n\r\nmodel <- brms::brm(\r\n  basePay | trunc(lb = 0) \r\n  ~ 1 \r\n  + jobTitle \r\n  + gender \r\n  + age \r\n  + perfEval \r\n  + edu \r\n  + seniority \r\n  + gender:edu \r\n  + gender:seniority \r\n  + gender:age \r\n  + gender:perfEval \r\n  + (1 + gender | dept),  \r\n  data = mydata %>% dplyr::mutate_if(is.factor, as.character),\r\n  family = gaussian(link = \"identity\"),\r\n  iter = 3000,\r\n  chains = 3,\r\n  cores = 6,\r\n  warmup = 1000,\r\n  seed = 2809,\r\n  control = list(\r\n    adapt_delta = 0.99, \r\n    max_treedepth = 20\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVýsledky analýzy\r\nDříve než přistoupíme k interpretaci výsledků analýzy je dobré si\r\nověřit, že náš statistický model dokáže dostatečně věrně napodobit či\r\nsimulovat data reprezentující firemní realitu, na jejíž vlastnosti\r\nchceme s pomocí tohoto modelu usuzovat. Za tímto účelem můžeme použít\r\nnástroj posteriorní prediktivní kontroly (posterior predictive\r\ncheck), který ověřuje, jak moc dobře námi zvolený a odhadnutý model\r\npredikuje pozorovaná data na základě vzorku posteriorních hodnot jeho\r\nparametrů. Z níže uvedeného grafu je dobře patrné, že náš model si z\r\ntohoto hlediska nevede vůbec špatně.\r\nPo této kontrole (a také po ověření dalších technických\r\nnáležitostí, jako je např. konvergence MCMC\r\nřetězců, které umožňují odhadnout posteriorneí distribuci parametrů i\r\nkomplexnějších statistických modelů jako je ten náš) můžeme začít\r\nvyužívat parametry našeho modelu k usuzování na pravděpodobné vlastnosti\r\nnámi studované firemní reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# investigating the model's fit\r\n\r\n# specifying the number of samples\r\nnsamples = 100\r\n\r\nbrms::pp_check(\r\n  model, \r\n  nsamples = nsamples\r\n  ) + \r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = stringr::str_glue(\"Posteriorní prediktivní kontrola modelu za použití vzorku o velikoti n = {nsamples}\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNíže je uveden souhrn informací o našem odhadnutém modelu. Primárně\r\nnás zajímá hodnota parametru pohlaví (genderMale) v sekci\r\nvěnované efektům na úrovni celé populace (Population-Level\r\nEffects). 95% interval kredibility (Credible Interval),\r\nkterý udává kam v posteriorním rozdělení spadá hodnota nepozorovaného\r\nparametru s 95% pravděpodobností, se nachází v rozmezí od -3750.04 USD\r\ndo 9081.92 USD, se střední hodnotou 2717.57. Tzn., že podle našeho\r\nmodelu má muž - při zohlednění ostatních faktorů a jejich vybraných\r\ninterakcí - typicky o cca 2700 USD vyšší základní mzdu než její ženský\r\nprotějšek. Analýza našich dat tak do určité míry podporuje hypotézu o\r\nexistenci platové diskriminace na základě pohlaví zaměstnance v námi\r\nstudované firmě. Síla důkazu ve prospěch této hypotézy však není nijak\r\nvýrazná, což vyplývá z toho, že 95% interval kredibility zahrnuje vedle\r\nkladných hodnot i nulovou hodnotu a záporné hodnoty parametru pohlaví\r\njako jeho plauzibilní hodnoty.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nsummary(model)\r\n\r\n\r\n Family: gaussian \r\n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \r\nFormula: basePay | trunc(lb = 0) ~ 1

To je v souladu\r\ns předchozím tvrzením, že důkaz ve prospěch testované hypotézy není\r\npříliš silný. Další možností by bylo použití tzv. Bayesova faktoru,\r\nkterý vyjadřuje míru s níž dostupná data favorizují testovanou hypotézu\r\nve srovnání s modelem odpovídajícím nulové hypotéze. Ten má pro naši\r\nhypotézu hodnotu 4, což odpovídá významnému, ale zdaleka nikoli silnému\r\nči rozhodnému důkazu ve prospěch naší hypotézy.\r\nVedle parametru pohlaví může být pro nás potenciálně užitečné podívat\r\nse také na vztah základní mzdy a ostatních prediktorů použitých v našem\r\nmodelu. Za tímto účelem můžeme použít vizualizaci marginálních efektů\r\njednotlivých prediktorů, které vyjadřují vztah mezi prediktorem a\r\nkritériem při zohlednění vlivu ostatních prediktorů. Takto např. můžeme\r\nna jednom z grafů vidět, že vztah mezi úrovní vzdělání a výší základního\r\nplatu se má tendenci u mužů a žen lišit. Na jiném grafu si můžeme zase\r\nvšimnout toho, že rozdíl mezi základní mzdou mužů a žen má tendenci\r\nnarůstat s tím, jak klesá seniorita zaměstnanců. Tyto a další podobné\r\nvhledy nám mohou pomoct přiblížit se k důvodům za pozorovanými\r\nnerovnostmi v platech mužů a žen.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# plotting marginal effects of predictors used \r\n# Note: Conditional vs. Marginal Relationships: The regression coefficients in generalized linear mixed models represent conditional effects in the sense that they express comparisons holding the cluster-specific random effects (and covariates) constant. For this reason, conditional effects are sometimes referred to as cluster-specific effects. In contrast, marginal effects can be obtained by averaging the conditional expectation μij over the random effects distribution. Marginal effects express comparisons of entire sub-population strata defined by covariate values and are sometimes referred to as population-averaged effects.In linear mixed models (identity link), the regression coefficents can be interpreted as either conditional or marginal effects. However, conditional and marginal effects differ for most other link functions.\r\n\r\nmarginalEffplots <- plot(\r\n  brms::marginal_effects(\r\n    model, \r\n    effects = c(\"jobTitle\", \"age\", \"perfEval\", \"edu\", \"seniority\", \"gender:edu\", \"gender:seniority\", \"gender:age\", \"gender:perfEval\"),\r\n    probs = c(0.025, 0.975)),\r\n  ask = FALSE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# putting all graphs with marginal effects together  \r\nggpubr::ggarrange(\r\n  plotlist = marginalEffplots, \r\n  nrow = 9,\r\n  ncol = 1\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMožné další kroky\r\nI v situaci, kdy analýza dat nepodpoří naše podezření na existenci\r\nplatové diskriminace na základě pohlaví zaměstnance, je stále možné, že\r\nza pozorovaným rozdílem v platech mužů a žen jsou jiné faktory, které s\r\npohlavím zaměstance nějak souvisí. Např. skutečnost, že jsou ženy méně\r\nreprezentované na lépe placených seniornějších pozicích, by mohla\r\nsvědčit o tom, že se ženy na pracovišti mohou potýkat s genderovými\r\nstereotypy a že při snaze o kariérní postup na lépe placené pozice\r\nnarážejí na tzv. “skleněný strop“. Pro učinění takového závěru je však\r\nzapotřebí získat další data, a to spíše kvalitativní povahy, taková,\r\nkterá sbírá a analyzuje např. organizační\r\nči firemní\r\nantropologie.\r\nV situaci, kdy máme dostatečně silné důkazy pro to, že se za\r\npozorovanou platovou nerovností mezi muži a ženami skrývají faktory\r\nsouvisející s pohlavím zaměstnance, je možné začít se poohlížet po\r\nmožných řešeních. Stejně jako při identifikaci problému, i při hledání\r\nzpůsobu jeho řešení je dobré držet se zásad na\r\ndůkazech založeného managementu a volit pouze řešení s dostatečně\r\nempiricky doloženou účinností, která zároveň dávají smysl ve specifickém\r\nkontextu dané firmy.\r\nUžitečný přehled možných akcí, které zaměstnavatelé mohou podniknout\r\ns cílem snížit GPG ve své organizaci, vytvořila známá skupina odborníků\r\nna behaviorální vědy v rámci tzv. The\r\nBehavioral Insights Team, která svého času vznikla pro to, aby\r\nbritské vládě pomáhala realizovat účinnou politiku založenou na\r\ndůkazech. V dokumentu s názvem Reducing the gender pay gap and\r\nimproving gender equality in organisations: Evidence-based actions for\r\nemployers tato skupina odborníků uvádí několik možných intervencí,\r\nkteré řadí do tří kategorií podle toho, jak dobře je jejich účinnost\r\npodložená empirickými důkazy.\r\nMezi akce s dobře doloženou účinností řadí\r\nnásledující intervence:\r\nZahrnutí většího počtu žen do užších seznamů v rámci výběru nových\r\nzaměstnanců a povyšování.\r\nPoužívání úloh posuzujících úroveň pracovních dovedností v rámci\r\nvýběru nových zaměstnanců.\r\nPoužívání strukturovaného interview v rámci výběru nových\r\nzaměstnanců a povyšování.\r\nPodpora vyjednávání o výši platu pomocí zvěřejnění existujícího\r\nplatového rozmezí.\r\nZavedení transparentních procesů povyšování a odměňování.\r\nJmenování manažera či zřízení pracovní skupiny pro firemní\r\ndiverzitu.\r\nMezi potenciálně slibné akce, které ale vyžadují další důkazy\r\no své účinnosti, řadí následující postupy:\r\nZvýšení pracovní flexibility pro muže a pro ženy.\r\nPodporu sdílené rodičovské dovolené.\r\nNábor bývalých zaměstnanců, kteří museli z různých osobních důvodů\r\nna delší dobu přerušit svou kariéru.\r\nNabídku mentoringu and sponsorshipu.\r\nNabídku networkingových programů.\r\nNastavení interních cílů.\r\nA mezi akce se smíšenými doklady o jejich účinnosti\r\npotom řadí následující opatření:\r\nŠkolení věnované tématu nevědomých předsudků.\r\nŠkolení v oblasti diverzity.\r\nŠkolení věnované rozvoji leadershipu.\r\nDemograficky různorodé výběrové panely v rámci externího i interního\r\nnáboru.\r\nZde je pro zájemce originální dokument k bližšímu prostudování.\r\n\r\n\r\nTento prohlížeč nepodporuje soubory PDF.

One way they can\r\nhelp us is by verifying that we have really achieved our stated goals\r\nand that we are not just fooling ourselves into believing so. We need to\r\nkeep in mind Richard\r\nFeynman’s famous principle of critical thinking…\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the tools that can help us with that is segmented\r\nregression analysis of interrupted time series data (thanks to Masatake\r\nHirono for pointing me to its existence). It allows us to model\r\nchanges in various processes and outcomes that follow interventions,\r\nwhile controlling for other types of changes (e.g. trends and\r\nseasonality) that may have occurred regardless of the interventions. It\r\nis thus very useful for data analysis conducted within studies with a quasi experimental\r\nstudy design that are often in the organizational context the best\r\nalternative to the “gold standard” of randomized\r\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) that are not always realizable or\r\npolitically acceptable.\r\nSearch\r\ninterest in work-life balance and well-being\r\nFor illustration, let’s use this tool for testing hypothesis about\r\npeople’s increased interest in topics related to work-life balance and\r\nwell-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent changes in the\r\nway people work. As a proxy measure of this interest we will use\r\nworldwide search interest data over the last 10 years from Google Trends using\r\nsearch terms work-life balance and well-being (see\r\nFig. 1 and 2 below).\r\nFig. 1: Interest in\r\n“work-life balance” topic over the last 10 years measured as a search\r\ninterest by Google Trends. The numbers represent search interest\r\nrelative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and\r\ntime. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50\r\nmeans that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means that there\r\nwas not enough data for this term.\r\n\r\nFig. 2: Interest in\r\n“well-being” topic over the last 10 years measured as a search interest\r\nby Google Trends. The numbers represent search interest relative to the\r\nhighest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100\r\nis the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term\r\nis half as popular. A score of 0 means that there was not enough data\r\nfor this term.\r\n\r\nBased solely on the visual inspection of the graphs, it is pretty\r\ndifficult to tell whether there was some effect of the COVID-19 pandemic\r\nor not, especially in the case of work-life balance (for the purpose of\r\nthis analysis, the beginning of the pandemic is assumed to have started\r\nin March 2020). For sure it’s not a job for “inter-ocular trauma test”\r\nwhen the existence of the effect hits you directly between the eyes. We\r\nneed to rely here on inferential statistics and its ability to help us\r\nwith distinguishing signal from noise.\r\nBefore conducting the analysis itself, we need to wrangle the data\r\nfrom Google Trends a little bit using the recipe presented in the\r\nWagner, Zhang, and Ross-Degnan’s paper. Specifically, we need the\r\nfollowing five variables (or six, given that we have two dependent\r\nvariables):\r\nsearch interest – numerical variable representing\r\nsearch interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given\r\nregion and time; this variable is truncated within the interval between\r\nvalues of 0 and 100; a value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term;\r\na value of 50 means that the term is half as popular; a score of 0 means\r\nthat there was not enough data for this term; this variable serves as a\r\ndependent (criterion) variable;\r\nelapsed time – numerical variable representing the\r\nnumber of months that elapsed from the beginning of the time series;\r\nthis variable enables estimation of the size and direction of the\r\noverall trend in the data;\r\npandemic – dichotomic variable indicating the\r\npresence/absence of pandemic; as already mentioned above, for the\r\npurpose of this analysis, the beginning of the pandemic is assumed to\r\nhave started in March 2020; this variable enables estimation of the\r\nlevel change in the interest in work-life balance and well-being\r\nimmediately after the pandemic outbreak;\r\nelapsed time after pandemic outbreak – numerical\r\nvariable representing the number of months that elapsed from the\r\nbeginning of pandemic; this variable enables estimation of the change in\r\nthe trend in the interest in work-life balance and well-being after the\r\noutbreak of pandemic;\r\nmonth – categorical variable representing specific\r\nmonth within a year; this variable enables controlling for the effect of\r\nseasonality.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for data manipulation\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\ndfWorkLifeBalance <-

1: Final dataset used for testing hypothesis about impact\r\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s interest in work-life balance and\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\nBayesian segmented\r\nregression\r\nWe will model our data using common segmented regression models that\r\nhave following general structure:\r\n\\[Y_{t} = β_{0} + β_{1}*time_{t} +\r\nβ_{2}*intervention_{t} + β_{3}*time after intervention_{t} +\r\ne_{t}\\]\r\nThe β0 coefficient estimates the baseline level\r\nof the outcome variable at time zero; β1 coefficient\r\nestimates the change in the mean of the outcome variable that occurs\r\nwith each unit of time before the intervention (i.e. the baseline\r\ntrend); β2 coefficient estimates the level change in\r\nthe mean of the outcome variable immediately after the intervention\r\n(i.e. from the end of the preceding segment); and β3\r\nestimates the change in the trend in the mean of the outcome variable\r\nper unit of time after the intervention, compared with the trend before\r\nthe intervention (thus, the sum of β1 and\r\nβ3 equals to the post-intervention slope).\r\nSince we are dealing with correlated and truncated data, we should\r\nalso include two additional terms in our model, an autocorrelation term\r\nand a truncation term, to handle these specific properties of our\r\ndata.\r\nNow let’s fit the models to the data and check what they tell us\r\nabout the effect of pandemic on people’s search interest in work-life\r\nbalance and well-being. We will use brms\r\nr package that enables making inferences about statistical models’\r\nparameters within Bayesian inferential framework. Because of that, we\r\nalso need to specify some additional parameters\r\n(e.g. chains, iter or warmup) of\r\nthe\r\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that will generate\r\nposterior samples of our models’ parameters.\r\nBayesian framework also enables us to specify priors for estimated\r\nparameter and through them include our domain knowledge in the analysis.\r\nThe specified priors are important for both parameter estimation and\r\nhypothesis testing as they define our starting information state before\r\nwe take into account our data. Here we will use rather wide,\r\nuninformative, and only mildly regularizing priors (it means that the\r\nresults of the inference will be very close to the results of standard,\r\nfrequentist parameter estimation/hypothesis testing).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for Bayesian statistical inference\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\n\r\n# checking available priors for the models \r\nbrms::get_prior(\r\n  workLifeBalance | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = dfAll,\r\n  family = gaussian())\r\n\r\nbrms::get_prior(\r\n  wellBeing | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = dfAll,\r\n  family = gaussian())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for Bayesian statistical inference\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\n\r\n# specifying wide, uninformative, and only mildly regularizing priors for predictors in both models \r\npriors <- c(set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"elapsedTime\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"elapsedTimeAfterPandemic\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthApr\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthAug\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthDec\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthFeb\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthJul\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthJun\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthMar\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthMay\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthNov\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthOct\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthSep\"))\r\n\r\n# defining the statistical model for work-life balance\r\nmodelWorkLifeBalance <- brms::brm(\r\n  workLifeBalance | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = dfAll,\r\n  family = gaussian(),\r\n  prior = priors,\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  iter = 3000,\r\n  warmup = 1000,\r\n  seed = 12345,\r\n  sample_prior = TRUE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n# defining the statistical model for well-being\r\nmodelWellBeing <- brms::brm(\r\n  wellBeing | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = dfAll,\r\n  family = gaussian(),\r\n  prior = priors,\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  iter = 3000,\r\n  warmup = 1000,\r\n  seed = 678910,\r\n  sample_prior = TRUE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome necessary sanity checks\r\nBefore making any inferences, we should make some sanity checks to be\r\nsure that the mechanics of the MCMC algorithm worked well and that we\r\ncan use generated posterior samples for making inferences about our\r\nmodels’ parameters. There are many ways for doing that, but here we will\r\nuse only visual check of the MCMC chains. We want plots of these chains\r\nlook like hairy caterpillar which would indicate convergence of the\r\nunderlying Markov chain to stationarity and convergence of Monte Carlo\r\nestimators to population quantities, respectively. As can be seen in\r\nGraph 1 and 2 below, in case of both models we can observe wanted\r\ncharacteristics of the MCMC chains described above. (For additional MCMC\r\ndiagnostics procedures, see for example Bayesian\r\nNotes from Jeffrey B. Arnold.)\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for plotting Bayesian models\r\nlibrary(bayesplot)\r\n\r\n# plotting the MCMC chains for the modelWorkLifeBalance \r\nbayesplot::mcmc_trace(\r\n  modelWorkLifeBalance,\r\n  facet_args = list(nrow = 6)\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Plots of the MCMC chains used for estimation of the modelWorkLifeBalance's parameters\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 1: Trace plots of Markov chains for individual parameters\r\nof the modelWorkLifeBalance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# plotting the MCMC chains for the modelWellBeing \r\nbayesplot::mcmc_trace(\r\n  modelWellBeing,\r\n  facet_args = list(nrow = 6)\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Plots of the MCMC chains used for estimation of the modelWellBeing's parameters\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 2: Trace plots of Markov chains for individual parameters\r\nof the modelWellBeing.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to check how well the models fit the data. We\r\ncan use for this purpose posterior predictive checks that use specified\r\nnumber of sampled posterior values of models’ parameters and show how\r\nwell the fitted models predict observed data. We can see in Graphs 3 and\r\n4 that both models fit the observed data reasonably well.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# investigating modelWorkLifeBalance fit\r\n\r\n# specifying the number of samples\r\nnsamples = 1000\r\n\r\nbrms::pp_check(\r\n  modelWorkLifeBalance, \r\n  nsamples = nsamples\r\n  ) + \r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = stringr::str_glue(\"Posterior predictive checks for modelWorkLifeBalance (using {nsamples} samples)\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 3: Posterior predictive checks comparing\r\nsimulated/replicated data under the fitted modelWorkLifeBalance with the\r\nobserved data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# investigating modelWellBeing fit\r\n\r\n# specifying the number of samples\r\nnsamples = 1000\r\n\r\nbrms::pp_check(\r\n  modelWellBeing, \r\n  nsamples = nsamples\r\n  ) + \r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = stringr::str_glue(\"Posterior predictive checks for modelWellBeing (using {nsamples} samples)\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 4: Posterior predictive checks comparing\r\nsimulated/replicated data under the fitted modelWellBeing with the\r\nobserved data.\r\n\r\nResults of the analysis\r\nNow, after having sufficient confidence that - using terminology from\r\nthe Richard\r\nMcElreath’s book Statistical Rethinking - our “small worlds” can\r\npretty accurately mimic the data coming from our real,“big world”, we\r\ncan use our models’ parameters to learn something about our research\r\nquestions. Our primary interest is in the coefficient value of the\r\npandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak term in our models. It\r\nexpresses how much and in what direction people’s search interest in\r\nwork-life balance and well-being changed immediately after the outbreak\r\nof pandemic.\r\nIn Graph 5 and 6 we can see posterior distribution of this parameter\r\nin our two models. In both cases the posterior distribution of the\r\npandemic term is (predominantly or completely) on the left side of the\r\nzero value, which supports the claim about existence of the effect of\r\npandemic on people’s increased search interest in work-life balance and\r\nwell-being. As is apparent from the graphs, for well-being (Graph 6)\r\nthis evidence is much stronger than for work-life balance (Graph 5),\r\nwhich corresponds to impression we might have when looking at the\r\noriginal Google Trends charts shown in Fig. 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for \r\nlibrary(tidybayes)\r\n\r\n# visualizing posterior distribution of the pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter in the modelWorkLifeBalance\r\nmodelWorkLifeBalance %>%\r\n  tidybayes::gather_draws(\r\n    b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    .variable = factor(\r\n      .variable, \r\n      levels = c(\"b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\"), \r\n      ordered = TRUE\r\n      )\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(value = .value) %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(\r\n    aes(x = value)\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_density(\r\n    fill = \"lightblue\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Posterior distribution of the pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter\\nin the modelWorkLifeBalance\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 5: Visualization of the posterior distribution of the\r\npandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter in the\r\nmodelWorkLifeBalance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# visualizing posterior distribution of the pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter in the modelWellBeing\r\nmodelWellBeing %>%\r\n  tidybayes::gather_draws(\r\n    b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    .variable = factor(\r\n      .variable, \r\n      levels = c(\"b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\"), \r\n      ordered = TRUE\r\n      )\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(value = .value) %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(\r\n    aes(x = value)\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_density(\r\n    fill = \"lightblue\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Posterior distribution of the pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter\\nin the modelWellBeing\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 5: Visualization of the posterior distribution of the\r\npandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter in the\r\nmodelWellBeing.\r\n\r\nTo generate more summary statistics about posterior distributions\r\n(and also some diagnostic information like Rhat or\r\nESS), we can use summary() function.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# generating a summary of the results for modelWorkLifeBalance \r\nsummary(modelWorkLifeBalance)\r\n\r\n\r\n Family: gaussian \r\n  Links: mu = identity;

For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\r\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\r\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven that for work-life balance model the posterior distribution of\r\npandemic term crosses the zero value, it would be useful to know how\r\nstrong is the evidence in the favor of hypothesis that pandemic term is\r\nlower than zero. For that purpose we can extract posterior samples and\r\nuse them for calculation of the proportion of values that are\r\nlarger/smaller than zero. The resulting proportions show that the vast\r\nmajority (around 92%) of posterior distribution lies below zero.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# extracting posterior samples\r\nsamples <- brms::posterior_samples(modelWorkLifeBalance, seed = 12345)\r\n\r\n# probability of b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak coefficient being lower than 0\r\nsum(samples$b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak < 0) / nrow(samples)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.920875\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# probability of b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak coefficient being higher than 0\r\nsum(samples$b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak > 0) / nrow(samples)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.079125\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to compute Bayes factor that\r\nexpresses degree to which available data favors our hypothesis in\r\ncomparison with the null model corresponding to normal prior\r\ndistribution with the parameters normal(0,50). We can see\r\nthat Bayes factor (Evid.Ratio in the table below) has value\r\nof 11.6 which indicates strong evidence in favor of our hypothesis, in\r\nterms of Harold\r\nJeffreys’ scale for interpretation of Bayes factors. Specifically it\r\nmeans that under the fitted model for work-life balance the hypothesis\r\nabout pandemic term being lower than zero is 11.6 times more probable\r\nthan under the null model. In other words, the data should shift our\r\nbelieve pretty strongly in direction of acceptance of the existence of\r\npandemic’s positive effect on people’s search interest in work-life\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# computing Bayes factor for hypothesis that pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak term in the modelWorkLifeBalance is smaller than zero  \r\nbrms::hypothesis(\r\n  modelWorkLifeBalance,\r\n  \"pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak < 0\",\r\n  seed = 12345\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nHypothesis Tests for class b:\r\n                Hypothesis Estimate Est.Error CI.Lower CI.Upper\r\n1 (pandemicBeforeth... < 0   -14.01      9.97   -30.28     2.57\r\n  Evid.Ratio Post.Prob Star\r\n1      11.64      0.92     \r\n---\r\n'CI': 90%-CI for one-sided and 95%-CI for two-sided hypotheses.\r\n'*': For one-sided hypotheses, the posterior probability exceeds 95%;\r\nfor two-sided hypotheses, the value tested against lies outside the 95%-CI.\r\nPosterior probabilities of point hypotheses assume equal prior probabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# plotting prior and posterior distribution for pandemic term in the modelWorkLifeBalance is smaller than zero   \r\nplot(\r\n  brms::hypothesis(\r\n    modelWorkLifeBalance,\r\n    \"pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak < 0\"\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 6: Visualization of prior and posterior distribution of\r\npandemic term in the modelWorkLifeBalance.\r\n\r\nBesides the major hypothesis we may be also interested in…\r\noverall trend across the last ten years,\r\ntrend after the outbreak of pandemic, and also\r\nseasonality of people’s search interest over the months within\r\nindividual years.\r\nFor that purpose we might use, besides the summary statistics and\r\ngraphs with posterior distributions depicted above, plots showing\r\nconditional effect of each of the predictors. From the plots in Graph 7\r\nit is thus clear that in case of work-life balance searches, the overall\r\ntrend across the last ten years is decreasing, after the outbreak of\r\npandemic the trend is rather stagnating, and within individual years the\r\nsearch interest follows work & holiday seasonality (lower search\r\ninterest during the holiday parts of the year - June, July, August and\r\nDecember - and higher during the rest of the year). In case of\r\nwell-being searches, the seasonality part is similar, but the trends\r\ndiffer - both of them are increasing (see Graph 8).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# plotting conditional effect of each predictor from modelWorkLifeBalance \r\nfigListWorkLifeBalance <- plot(brms::conditional_effects(modelWorkLifeBalance), ask = FALSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for arranging multiple ggplots\r\nlibrary(ggpubr)\r\n\r\n# putting all graphs with conditional effect together  \r\nggpubr::ggarrange(\r\n  plotlist = figListWorkLifeBalance, \r\n  nrow = 4\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  ggpubr::annotate_figure(\r\n    top = text_grob(\"Conditional effect of predictors from modelWorkLifeBalance\")\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 7: Visualization of conditional effect of predictors from\r\nmodelWorkLifeBalance.

I wish us all to be able to\r\ntransform our increased interest in these topics into truly increased\r\nquality of our personal and professional lives. It would be a shame not\r\nto use that extra incentive many of us have now for making significant\r\nchange in our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

V několika\r\nposledních letech potom k tomu navíc přidává nadstavbu v podobě\r\npokročilejších analytických postupů, které mají větší potenciál přijít s\r\nhlubšími vhledy a s doporučeními s větším efektem. Ale ať už využíváte\r\npouze základní reporting nebo nějakou pokročilejší analytiku, cíl je\r\nvždy stejný – snažit se s pomocí dat a jejich analýzy žádoucím způsobem\r\novlivnit jednotlivé HR procesy, které organizacím pomáhají dosahovat\r\njejich strategických cílů. Názorně to ilustruje níže uvedené schéma\r\nzachycující mechanismus propojující HR procesy s (nejen) finančními\r\nvýsledky organizace (Paauwe\r\n& Richardson, 1997).\r\n\r\nHR analytika pomáhá optimalizovat nastavení tohoto mechanismu tím, že\r\numožňuje nalézat odpovědi na některé klíčové otázky, jako např.:\r\nKterými kanály se k nám dostávají ti nejlepší kandidáti?\r\nJaké charakteristiky od sebe odlišují úspěšné a neúspěšné\r\nkandidáty?\r\nKteré faktory přispívají k úspěšnému onboardingu?\r\nKterá „kápéíčka“ mají nejsilnější vazbu na finanční výsledky\r\nfirmy?\r\nJaké tréninky vedou s nejvyšší pravděpodobností ke zlepšení\r\npracovního výkonu?\r\nKteré intervence mají největší dopad na zaměstnanci pociťovaný\r\nwell-being nebo work-life balance?\r\nCo u zaměstnanců zvyšuje, nebo naopak snižuje míru jejich\r\nangažovanosti?\r\nKde se v organizaci nachází izolovaná sila a úzká hrdla znemožňující\r\nefektivní komunikaci a spolupráci mezi jednotlivými zaměstnanci, týmy\r\nnebo i celými odděleními?\r\nKdo představuje skrytý talent, který je potřeba podchytit a dále\r\nrozvíjet?\r\nKde lze očekávat odpor v souvislosti s plánovanými změnami ve firmě\r\na kdo naopak může být jejich ambasadorem a katalyzátorem?\r\nKteré faktory přispívají k odchodovosti zaměstnanců a u kterých\r\nkonkrétních zaměstnanců je zvýšené riziko, že firmu během několika\r\npříštích měsíců opustí?\r\nOdchodovost\r\nzaměstnanců a její prediktory\r\nPrávě posledně jmenovaný způsob využití HR analytiky často\r\npředstavuje jeden z prvních druhů HR analytických projektů, kterými se\r\nve firmách s HR analytikou začíná, a to z dobře pochopitelného důvodu. S\r\nnežádoucími odchody zaměstnanců jsou totiž spojené vysoké\r\npřímé i nepřímé náklady, takže i poměrně mírné snížení odchodovosti\r\nzaměstnanců může představovat značnou úsporu, kterou ocení management\r\nkaždé firmy. Naléhavost tohoto problému navíc ještě zvyšuje současná\r\nfáze ekonomického cyklu s rekordně nízkou mírou nezaměstnanosti, která v\r\nkombinaci s různými on-line platformami na zprostředkování práce\r\nmotivuje mnoho lidí k hledání nového místa, kde, jak doufají, bude práce\r\nzajímavější, smysluplnější a lépe placená a kde kolegové budou\r\nsympatičtější a šéfové inspirativnější. Viz také graf níže, který na\r\ndatech z USA názorně dokládá těsnost vztahu mezi mírou nezaměstnanosti a\r\nmírou dobrovolné odchodovosti zaměstnanců (r = -0,95,\r\np < 0,001 ).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVzhledem k palčivosti tohoto problému, který trápí nejednu firmu,\r\nnení žádným velkým překvapením, že se tématu odchodovosti zaměstnanců\r\nvěnovalo a stále věnuje velké množství různých studií. Takto např. na\r\nkonci roku 2017 vyšla rozsáhlá meta-analýza od autorů Rubensteina,\r\nEberlyové a Leeho, kteří syntetizovali výsledky více než 300 dílčích\r\nvýzkumů týkajících se prediktorů odchodovosti. Můžeme se tak oprávněně\r\nptát, co nového nám může přinést HR analytika zaměřená na odchodovost\r\nzaměstnanců realizovaná pouze v jediné organizaci. Nebylo vše podstatné\r\nk tomuto tématu již objeveno? (K této otázce viz např. tento\r\ninspirativní a trochu provokativní článek od Thomase\r\nRasmussena.) Je pravda, že není příliš pravděpodobné, že při analýze\r\nvašich vlastních dat narazíte na nějaký naprosto nový faktor související\r\ns odchodovostí. Na druhou stranu je rovněž pravda, že každá organizace\r\nje v něčem jedinečná, takže některé z retenčních faktorů pro danou\r\norganizaci budou pravděpodobně více a jiné méně důležité. Tato informace\r\no relativní důležitosti jednotlivých retenčních faktorů je potom klíčová\r\npři nastavování retenčního plánu a HR analytika může být při tomto\r\nvelice nápomocná.\r\nNa důkazech založená\r\npro-retenční opatření\r\nS pomocí tohoto\r\ndashboardu - vytvořeného prostřednictvím analytického nástroje R a vizualizačního nástroje Shiny a za\r\nvyužití ukázkových\r\ndat od společnosti IBM - si můžete sami vyzkoušet, jak užitečné by\r\npro Vás mohly být výstupy z takového HR analytického projektu zaměřeného\r\nna odchodovost zaměstnanců. Dashboard obsahuje informace, které pomáhají\r\n(nejen) managementu zodpovědět řadu klíčových otázek, které stojí na\r\npočátku každého účinného plánu na retenci zaměstnanců, jako např.:\r\nKolik zaměstnanců nás ročně opouští?\r\nKteré skupiny zaměstnanců odcházejí nejčastěji?\r\nJaký je externí benchmark? Jsme na tom podobě jako konkurence v\r\noboru?\r\nPředstavuje pro nás stávající úroveň odchodovosti závažný problém, a\r\nvyplatí se nám ho tedy řešit?\r\nZ jakých důvodů lidé obecně nejčastěji odcházejí ze zaměstnání?\r\nJaké faktory přispívají k odchodu specificky našich\r\nzaměstnanců?\r\nJaká pro-retenční opatření jsou obecně k dispozici?\r\nJaká pro-retenční opatření bychom měli zvolit vzhledem k\r\npravděpodobným důvodům odchodů našich zaměstnanců?\r\nNa jaké skupiny zaměstnanců se především zaměřit z hlediska prevence\r\njejich odchodovosti?\r\nU kterých konkrétních zaměstnanců existuje zvýšené riziko, že\r\nodejdou, a na jaké konkrétní retenční faktory se u nich zaměřit v rámci\r\npravidelného stay interview?\r\nJak je z výše uvedeného výčtu otázek patrné, dashboard obsahuje\r\ninformace, které při svém rozhodování mohou využít nejen HR\r\nmanažeři, ale také HR business partneři nebo přímo team-leadeři a\r\nlinioví manažeři jednotlivých týmů či oddělení. Kromě toho\r\ndashboard obsahuje také řadu technických detailů o použitém predikčním\r\nmodelu a samotná data, které stojí v pozadí všech prezentovaných\r\nvizualizací a analýz. S jejich pomocí tak HR/Business\r\nanalytik může např. hledat optimální způsob, jak nastavit\r\nskórovací algoritmus, aby se maximalizoval pozitivní efekt\r\npro-retenčních opatření, nebo může v dostupných datech sám hledat nějaké\r\ndalší užitečné informace. Více viz již samotný\r\ndashboard, z něhož můžete níže vidět několik screenshotů.\r\nScreenshot části dashboardu, která obsahuje různé řezy\r\nodchodovostí zaměstnanců, a dává tak dobrý přehled o tom, které skupiny\r\nzaměstnanců jsou odchodovostí nejvíce ohrožené.\r\nScreenshot části dashboardu, která obsahuje informace o\r\npravděpodobnosti odchodu jednotlivých zaměstnanců společně s dalšími\r\ninformacemi, které mohou posloužit jako podklad pro individuální\r\nintervence s cílem předejít nežádoucím odchodům zaměstnanců.\r\n\r\nScreenshot části dashboardu, která obsahuje informace o\r\nvýkonu/kvalitě statistického modelu použitého k identifikaci významných\r\nprediktorů odchodovosti zaměstnanců a k odhadu pravděpodobnosti odchodu\r\njednotlivých zaměstnanců. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Téměř\r\nvšichni z oboru už o HR analytice něco slyšeli, něco o ní vědí a\r\npřípadně se jí už také pokouší ve svých organizacích v nějaké podobě\r\nzavádět. Zároveň většinou uznávají její důležitost při transformaci HR z\r\npodpůrné a administrativní funkce na funkci, která dokáže organizacím\r\nbezprostředně pomáhat dosahovat jejich strategických cílů. Navzdory\r\ntomuto všeobecnému povědomí o HR analytice a navzdory řadě úspěšně\r\nrealizovaných HR analytických projektů (viz např. série článků od Davida Greena - článek\r\n1, článek\r\n2, článek\r\n3, článek\r\n4) překvapivě málo organizací HR analytiku reálně a systematicky\r\nvyužívá. Tento stav reflektují i výsledky výzkumu 2018\r\nHuman Capital Trends od společnosti Deloitte, ze kterých vyplývá, že\r\norganizace si většinou uvědomují strategickou důležitost výzvy, kterou\r\npředstavuje datifikace HR, zároveň se ale necítí být na čelení této\r\nvýzvě příliš dobře připraveny. Už nějakou dobu platí, že když už se v\r\norganizaci s HR daty nějak pracuje, tak je to většinou pouze na úrovni\r\nnějakého základního reportingu vybraných HR metrik a KPIs typu náklady\r\nna nábor, délka období neobsazenosti volné pracovní pozice, míra\r\nne/dobrovolné odchodovosti zaměstnanců, počet zaměstnanců na jednoho HR\r\nbusiness partnera apod. Slabinou tohoto přístupu je, že takto sledované\r\nmetriky jsou často relevantní pouze pro monitorování a řízení\r\nefektivnosti HR coby nákladového střediska, ale již méně pro dosahování\r\nstrategických cílů organizace. Spíše výjimečně se potom v tomto kontextu\r\nvyužívají nějaké pokročilejší analytiky, které obecně mají větší\r\npotenciál přicházet s doporučeními s přímým dopadem na schopnost\r\norganizací dosahovat svých strategických cílů.\r\nVýsledky výzkumu\r\nprovedeného společnostmi MIT Sloan Management Review a SAS\r\nnaznačují, že tento nevyužitý potenciál HR analytiky má dvě hlavní\r\npříčiny. První z nich je to, že tradiční HR mnohdy postrádá analytický\r\nmindset a některé z kompetencí, které jsou klíčové pro úspěšnou\r\nrealizaci HR analytických projektů (přehled těchto kompetencí a důsledků\r\njejich absence či nedostatečné úrovně viz např. tento\r\nčlánek od Mortena Kamp\r\nAndersena). Ve stejném duchu Josh Bersin ve své zprávě\r\nHR\r\nTechnology Disruptions for 2018 konstatuje, že zvládnutí základních\r\nanalytických dovedností patří mezi nejdůležitější prediktory efektivní\r\nimplementace HR analytiky v organizacích: “Equip all HR staff with\r\nbasic data literacy skills. All HR practitioners should know basic\r\nstatistical concepts, where to find data, how to slice and dice it, how\r\nto read a dashboard, and how to bring data and analytics to bear on\r\nbusiness issues. Our research reveals that such basic skills are among\r\nthe most important predictors of high-performing people\r\nanalytics.”\r\nDruhou hlavní příčinou je potom to, že HR analytické projekty\r\nnebývají ukotveny v rámci nějaké širší strategie, jak data systematicky\r\nvyužívat při řízení lidských zdrojů, navíc způsobem, který by byl\r\nsladěný se strategickými cíli společnosti. Zde platí praxí osvědčená\r\npravda projektového managementu, že při implementaci projektů je potřeba\r\nvždy začínat od konce. V kontextu HR analytických projektů to tedy\r\nznamená začínat nikoli od dat, ale od toho, k čemu mají být HR\r\nanalytické výstupy použity. A očekávání managementu je, že HR analytika\r\nbude v posledku hlavně pomáhat zlepšovat obchodní výsledky společnosti.\r\nNázorně to ilustruje níže uvedené schéma (převzaté z článku\r\nMaxe Blumberga),\r\nkteré zachycuje předpokládaný kauzální řetězec spojující HR procesy s\r\nobchodními výsledky. Úkolem HR analytiky je potom s pomocí dat a\r\nanalytických nástrojů tyto dvě oblasti propojit a zjistit, jak\r\noptimalizací prvního zajistit zlepšení toho druhého.\r\n\r\nŘadě organizací by v tomto ohledu mohl být inspirací známý příběh oaklandského\r\nbaseballového týmu „Áček“, který se stal předlohou pro knihu Moneyball a z\r\nní vycházející stejnojmenný film.\r\nPrávě tento příběh jako jeden z prvních ukázal a mezi širokou veřejností\r\nzpopularizoval možnosti využití statistické analýzy ve světě sportu a\r\npotažmo také v rámci řízení lidských zdrojů. Díky radikální změně\r\ndosavadního přístupu k výběru nových hráčů, který se začal více opírat o\r\nvýstupy statistické analýzy sabermetrických\r\ndat o herním chování hráčů, dokázal management oaklandského\r\nbaseballového týmu „Áček“ přijímat rozhodnutí, která z jednoho z\r\nnejchudších týmů americké baseballové ligy učinila jeden z\r\nnejúspěšnějších týmů soutěže (měřeno počtem vítězství v základní části\r\nsoutěže a počtem postupů do play-off). Abychom mohli tento příběh plně\r\nvytěžit coby inspiraci, jak analyzovat svá vlastní zaměstnanecká data,\r\nbude užitečné, když se na jednotlivé analytické kroky, které stály v\r\npozadí úspěchu oklandských “Áček”, podíváme trochu podrobněji. A učiníme\r\ntak za využití volně dostupného statistického softwaru R a veřejně\r\ndostupné databáze\r\nhistorických údajů o výsledcích v americké baseballové lize.\r\n1.\r\nkrok: Začít od konce aneb strategický rámec HR analytiky\r\nJak bylo uvedeno výše, často podceňovaným krokem při zavádění HR\r\nanalytiky do firem a organizací je zasazení HR analytiky do nějakého\r\nširšího strategického rámce, ze kterého by jasně vyplývalo, čemu má\r\nvlastně HR analytika sloužit. HR analytika je pouze nástroj, konkrétně\r\nnástroj na zodpovídání otázek, resp. na testování různých hypotéz. To,\r\nzda bude tento nástroj užitečný, závisí na tom, zda si dokážeme klást ty\r\nsprávné otázky. To je přitom z velké části dáno tím, zda si jsme vědomi,\r\njaké jsou strategické cíle naší organizace. Jen ve světle těchto cílů\r\ndává smysl klást si nějaké otázky, sbírat a analyzovat nějaká data za\r\núčelem nalezení odpovědí na položené otázky a posléze činit nějaká\r\nkonkrétní rozhodnutí na základě nalezených odpovědí. V případě\r\noaklandských „Áček“ byl cíl jasný – kvalifikovat se do play-off.\r\n2. krok: Definice\r\nproblému a kvantifikace cíle\r\nPaul\r\nDePodesta, kterého generální manažer oaklandských „Áček“ Billy Beane přijal\r\ndo týmu jako statistického analytika, redukoval tento cíl na celkem\r\njednoduchý matematický problém: Kolik zápasů musí tým vyhrát, aby se\r\nkvalifikoval do play-off?

V případě oaklandských „Áček“ se\r\nmůžeme ptát, díky čemu tým dosahuje v zápasech vítězství? Celkem zjevná\r\nodpověď zní, že díky tomu, že dokáže získat více bodů než jeho soupeři.\r\nOtázkou ale je, přesně o kolik bodů navíc musí tým získat, aby v\r\nzákladní části soutěže dosáhl na minimálně 95 vítězství. K zodpovězení\r\ntéto otázky opět potřebujeme historická data (údaje o vyhraných a\r\nprohraných bodech) a relativně jednoduchý statistický model zvaný lineární\r\nregrese, pomocí kterého můžeme popsat vztah mezi počtem vyhraných\r\nzápasů v základní části soutěže a rozdílem mezi vyhranými a prohranými\r\nbody. Z níže uvedeného grafu je zřejmé, že mezi těmito dvěma proměnnými\r\nje velice těsný vztah a že spolu velice silně korelují.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si rozdíl mezi vyhranými a prohranými body\r\nmoneyball <- moneyball %>%\r\n  mutate(RD = RS - RA)\r\n\r\n# Graficky si znázorněme vztah mezi počtem vyhraných zápasů v základní části soutěže a rozdílem mezi vyhranými a prohranými body\r\nlibrary(ggpubr)\r\nggplot(moneyball, aes(x = RD , y = W))+\r\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2)+\r\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)+\r\n  ggtitle(\"Vztah mezi počtem vítězství v základní části soutěže a\\nrozdílem mezi vyhranými a prohranými body\")+\r\n  xlab(\"Rozdíl mezi počtem vyhraných a prohraných bodů\")+\r\n  ylab(\"Počet vítězství\")+\r\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 11),\r\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 11))+\r\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-350,350), breaks = seq(-350,350,50))+\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40, 120), breaks = seq(40,120,10))+\r\n  stat_cor(method = \"pearson\", label.x = 175, label.y = 45)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPři použití modelu lineární regrese můžeme vztah mezi těmito dvěma\r\nproměnnými popsat trochu podrobněji.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Regresní analýza vztahu mezi mezi počtem vyhraných zápasů v základní části soutěže a rozdílem mezi vyhranými a prohranými body \r\nreg_model1 <- glm(W ~ RD, data = moneyball, family = \"gaussian\")\r\nsummary(reg_model1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCall:\r\nglm(formula = W ~ RD, family = \"gaussian\", data = moneyball)\r\n\r\nDeviance Residuals: \r\n     Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max  \r\n-14.2662   -2.6509    0.1234    2.9364   11.6570  \r\n\r\nCoefficients:\r\n             Estimate Std.

Tzn., že při vyrovnaném poměru\r\nvyhraných a prohraných bodů můžeme očekávat, že tým vyhraje přibližně 80\r\nzápasů za sezónu, a že když se rozdílové skóre navýší o deset bodů,\r\nmůžeme očekávat, že tým vyhraje v průměru o jeden zápas za sezónu navíc.\r\nKlíčové je ale pro nás to, že s pomocí této rovnice a s trochou algebry\r\nsi můžeme jednoduše vypočítat, že k dosažení minimálně 95 vítězství za\r\nsezónu potřebuje tým vyhrát přibližně o 133 bodů více, než kolik jich se\r\nsoupeři prohraje ((95 - 80.88) / 0.106).\r\n4. krok: Kladení\r\ndalších otázek a další měření\r\nTímto zjištěním se náš cíl opět trochu více specifikuje a vyvolává\r\ndalší otázky. Otázka, která se téměř sama nabízí, se týká charakteristik\r\nhráčů, které nejlépe předpovídají počet vyhraných a prohraných bodů, a\r\ntím tedy také pravděpodobnost postupu týmu do play-off. DePodesta na\r\nzákladě svých analýz zjistil, že počet vyhraných bodů nejtěsněji souvisí\r\ns procentem případů, kdy se hráč dostane na metu (tzv. On-Base\r\nPercentage - OBP), a to, jak daleko se hráč dostane při svém odpalu\r\n(tzv. Slugging Percentage - SLG). Analogické statistiky pro\r\ntýmy soupeřů (OOBP a OSLG) potom stejně dobře předpovídají počet\r\nprohraných bodů. Když vztah mezi těmito proměnnými popíšeme opět pomocí\r\nmodelu lineární regrese, můžeme se s jeho pomocí pokusit předpovědět,\r\njak si tým povede příští sezónu. Taková předpověď by přitom mohla být\r\npotenciálně velice užitečná, protože na jejím základě bychom případně\r\nmohli upravit některá svá rozhodnutí o koupi nebo prodeji vybraných\r\nhráčů. Pojďme tuto předpověď vytvořit pro tým oaklandských „Áček“ pro\r\nsezónu 2002 na základě dat z let 1962-2001. Z předchozí analýzy již\r\nvíme, že…\r\nPočet vítězství = 80.88 + 0.106 x (Počet vyhraných bodů - Počet\r\nprohraných bodů).\r\nNyní potřebujeme určit, jaký bude pravděpodobný počet vyhraných a\r\nprohraných bodů.

V něm budou mít\r\noaklandská “Áčka” podobu jednoduchého stroje na výrobu postupů do\r\nplay-off - viz obrázek níže.\r\n\r\nZe schématu je dobře patrné, jak tento stroj funguje: Jeho výstupy\r\njsou postupy do play-off, kterých dosahuje tak, že se snaží vyhrát více\r\nzápasů, resp. získat více bodů než soupeřící týmy; k tomu využívá vstupy\r\nv podobě schopnosti hráčů hrát dobře na pálce a v poli; vstupem\r\novlivňujícím chod stroje jsou rovněž obdobné schopnosti hráčů\r\nsoupeřících týmů. Jedná se samozřejmě o velmi zjednodušený kauzální\r\nmodel fungování týmu oakladnských “Áček”, ale jak konstatuje slavný\r\nstatistický aforismus, modely jsou\r\nvždy nepřesné, ale některé z nich jsou užitečné.\r\nJakkoli naše modely fungování organizace budou vždy neúplné, je\r\ndůležité ověřit, zda tyto modely i přes svou omezenost v dostatečné míře\r\nodrážejí realitu tak, jak nám ji zprostředkovávají dostupná data. Za\r\ntímto účelem můžeme použít statistickou metodu strukturálního\r\nmodelování, která umožňuje formalizovat naše představy o vzájemných\r\nvztazích mezi několika různými proměnnými a zhodnotit míru souladu\r\ntěchto našich představ s dostupnými daty. Teprve po takovém zhodnocení\r\nvěrohodnosti modelu je rozumné na něm zakládat svá další rozhodnutí.\r\nPojďme tedy tuto metodu použít rovněž na náš nově vytvořený model\r\nfungování týmu oaklandských “Áček” a ověřit míru jeho věrohodnosti.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Data, která budeme potřebovat pro ověření věrohodnosti našeho modelu fungování oaklandských \"Áček\" \r\nsem_data <- moneyball %>%\r\n  filter(Year < 2002 & Year > 1995) %>%\r\n  select(RS, RA, RD, W, Playoffs, OBP, SLG, OOBP, OSLG)\r\n\r\n# Definice modelu, která je v souladu s výše uvedeným schématem\r\nlibrary(lavaan)\r\noak_model <- '\r\n     Playoffs ~ W\r\n     W ~ RS + RA\r\n     RA ~ OOBP + OSLG\r\n     RS ~ OBP + SLG \r\n'\r\n# Odhad parametrů modelu\r\nfit_oak_model <- sem(oak_model, data = sem_data, missing = \"pairwise\", estimator = \"WLSMV\", ordered = \"Playoffs\")\r\nsummary(fit_oak_model, standardized = T, fit.measures = T, rsq = T)\r\n\r\n\r\nlavaan 0.6-9 ended normally after 148 iterations\r\n\r\n  Estimator                                       DWLS\r\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\r\n  Number of model parameters                        14\r\n                                                      \r\n                                                  Used       Total\r\n  Number of observations                            90         176\r\n  Number of missing patterns                         1            \r\n                                                                  \r\nModel Test User Model:\r\n                                              Standard      Robust\r\n  Test Statistic                                 8.354      10.470\r\n  Degrees of freedom                                15          15\r\n  P-value (Chi-square)                           0.909       0.789\r\n  Scaling correction factor                                  1.159\r\n  Shift parameter                                            3.260\r\n       simple second-order correction                             \r\n\r\nModel Test Baseline Model:\r\n\r\n  Test statistic                               167.943     150.692\r\n  Degrees of freedom                                 6           6\r\n  P-value                                        0.000       0.000\r\n  Scaling correction factor                                  1.119\r\n\r\nUser Model versus Baseline Model:\r\n\r\n  Comparative Fit Index (CFI)                    1.000       1.000\r\n  Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)                       1.016       1.013\r\n                                                                  \r\n  Robust Comparative Fit Index (CFI)                            NA\r\n  Robust Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)                               NA\r\n\r\nRoot Mean Square Error of Approximation:\r\n\r\n  RMSEA                                          0.000       0.000\r\n  90 Percent confidence interval -

RMSEA, a také vysoké hodnoty standardizovaných\r\nregresních koeficientů). Dávají nám tak dobrý důvod věřit, že naše další\r\nkroky a rozhodnutí, která založíme na tomto modelu, budou mít žádoucí\r\nefekt na požadované výstupy, tj. na postup oaklandských “Áček” do\r\nplay-off.\r\n6. krok: Intervence\r\nNa základě výše uvedených zjištění začal management oaklandských\r\n„Áček“ do svého týmu vybírat hráče, kteří sice nevyhovovali tradičním\r\nkritériím, podle kterých hráčští skauti posuzovali kvalitu baseballových\r\nhráčů, ale za to vykazovali přesně ty charakteristiky, které podle\r\nDePodestových analýz předpovídaly počet vyhraných a prohraných bodů, a\r\npotažmo tedy také pravděpodobnost účasti v play-off, která byla hlavním\r\ncílem managementu. Díky tomu, že konkurenční týmy důležitost těchto\r\nhráčských statistik podceňovaly a naopak přeceňovaly jiné, méně důležité\r\nproměnné (např. míru úspěšnosti odpalů, tzv. Batting Average),\r\nmohl management oaklandských „Áček“ relativně levně skupovat hráče,\r\nkteří jim umožňovali dosahovat stanoveného cíle. Výsledkem bylo to, že\r\noaklandská „Áčka“ vyhrávala zhruba o 20 zápasů za sezónu více než stejně\r\n„chudé“ týmy a přibližně stejně tolik zápasů jako 2krát až 3krát bohatší\r\nkonkurence - viz graf níže.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Načtěme si potřebná data Lahmanovy baseballové databáze, která je veřejně přístupná na adrese http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/\r\nmzdyHracu <- read_csv(\"salaries.csv\")\r\nvyhryTymu <- read_csv(\"teams.csv\")\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si průměrnou sumu mezd vyplácených jednotlivými týmy svým hráčům v letech 1998-2001 \r\nprumerna_suma_MezdHracu <- mzdyHracu %>%\r\n  filter(yearID > 1997 & yearID < 2002) %>%\r\n  group_by(teamID) %>%\r\n  summarise(prumerna_suma_MezdHracu = sum(salary)/length(unique(yearID)))\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si pro jednotlivé týmy průměrný počet výher za sezónu v letech 1998-2001\r\nprumerny_pocet_vyher <- vyhryTymu %>%\r\n  filter(yearID > 1997 & yearID < 2002) %>%\r\n  group_by(teamID) %>%\r\n  summarise(prumerny_pocet_vyher = sum(W)/length(unique(yearID)))\r\n\r\n# Vyjádřeme si graficky vztah mezi počtem výher a množstvím peněz, které týmy vynakládají na mzdy svých hráčů \r\nlibrary(ggrepel)\r\nprumerna_suma_MezdHracu %>%\r\n  left_join(prumerny_pocet_vyher, \"teamID\") %>%\r\n  mutate(OAK = ifelse(teamID == \"OAK\", \"ano\", \"ne\")) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x= prumerna_suma_MezdHracu, y = prumerny_pocet_vyher, fill = OAK)) +\r\n  geom_point()+\r\n  ggtitle(\"Mzdy hráčů a počet vítězství v letech 1998-2001\")+\r\n  xlab(\"Průměrná suma mezd hráčů (USD)\")+\r\n  ylab(\"Průměrný počet výher za sezónu\")+\r\n  geom_label_repel(\r\n    aes(label = teamID),\r\n    box.padding = 0.25, point.padding = 0.25,\r\n    segment.color = 'grey50')+\r\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")+\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#ffd400\", \"#ffffff\"), \r\n                        labels = c(\"ano\",\"ne\"))+\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(65,100), breaks = seq(65,100,5)) +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(2e+07,9e+07), breaks = seq(2e+07,9e+07,1e+07))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmezení HR analytiky\r\nPřes veškerou přidanou hodnotu, kterou HR analytika pro organizaci\r\nmůže mít, je vhodné si vůči ní zachovat zdravou míru skepse a být si\r\nvědom jejích omezení. Níže uvádím přehled několika z nich.\r\nKvalita a užitečnost výstupů HR analytiky je závislá na kvalitě\r\ndat, která do ní vstupují. Jako kdekoli jinde i zde platí okřídlené\r\nrčení „rubbish in, rubbish out“. Schopnost získat potřebná data\r\nvčas, v dostatečné kvalitě a v dostatečném množství přitom představuje\r\njedno z nejužších hrdel celého procesu zavádění HR analytiky v\r\norganizacích.\r\nHR analytika pracuje s historickými daty a vychází z předpokladu,\r\nže minulost je dobrým prediktorem budoucnosti. Ale jak nás na to\r\nopakovaně upozorňují odborníci jako Nassim\r\nTaleb nebo Philip\r\nTetlock, tento vztah mezi minulostí a budoucností platí pouze do\r\nurčité míry a pouze v relativně krátkém časovém horizontu. Na každém\r\nrohu na nás číhá nějaká potenciální černá\r\nlabuť, která může postavit na hlavu všechno, co jsme se na základě\r\nnašich minulých zkušeností naučili brát jako samozřejmou\r\njistotu.\r\nNe každé prostředí je stejně předvídatelné jako svět sportu.\r\nPoměr signálu\r\na šumu se může napříč různými oblastmi významně lišit a čím více\r\npřevládá náhodný šum nad signálem, tím méně jsou výstupy z HR analytiky\r\nužitečné. Příkladem zde může být relativně neúspěšná snaha předpovídat\r\nto, jak si baseballové týmu povedou v play-off. Na rozdíl od základní\r\nčásti soutěže, kde se hraje dostatek zápasů na to, aby se vyrušil vliv\r\nnáhodného štěstí a smůly, v pětizápasových kolech play-off hraje náhoda\r\ntak významnou roli, že souvislost mezi celkovým počtem vítězství v\r\nzákladní části a pořadím týmu v play-off je téměř nulová.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Vyfiltrujme si data mezi lety 1994-2011, kdy v play-off hraje 8 týmů.\r\nmoneyball3 <- moneyball %>%\r\n  filter(Year < 2012 & Year > 1993)\r\n  \r\n# Výpočtěme si Kendallovu pořadovou korelaci mezi mezi celkovýmm počtem vítězství v základní části soutěže a pořadím týmu v play-off mezi lety 1994-2011. \r\nsuppressWarnings(cor.test(~ W + RankPlayoffs, data = moneyball3, method = \"kendall\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Kendall's rank correlation tau\r\n\r\ndata:  W and RankPlayoffs\r\nz = -0.48318, p-value = 0.629\r\nalternative hypothesis: true tau is not equal to 0\r\nsample estimates:\r\n        tau \r\n-0.05541167 \r\n\r\nČísla mají tu zvláštní moc, že dokážou v člověku velice snadno\r\nvzbudit dojem, že toho víme mnohem více než je tomu ve skutečnosti. Je\r\nvšak dobré si být vědom toho, že každá statistická předpověď je vždy\r\nzatížena nějakou mírou chyby, tu větší, tu menší. Velkou výhodou\r\nstatistických modelů je to, že tato chyba je u nich explicitně\r\nvyčíslena, takže s ní lze dopředu počítat a zohlednit ji při následném\r\nrozhodování. Tato „upřímnost“ ohledně své vlastní omylnosti paradoxně\r\nmnohdy staví statistické modely do horšího světla než jinak méně přesné\r\nintuitivní úsudky expertů, pro které podobné údaje o míře jejich\r\nomylnosti většinou nejsou vůbec k dispozici.\r\nVelikost výhody, kterou nám zavedení HR analytiky dává, může být\r\nzávislá na tom, zda podobné postupy využívá také naše konkurence. Opět\r\nto lze celkem dobře doložit na oaklandských „Áčkách“. Jejich výsledky se\r\nmezi lety 2002 až 2012, tj. v době po zveřejnění Moneyballu, kdy již\r\nvšechny týmy měly příležitost seznámit se s principy prediktivní\r\nanalytiky a zavést ji do své praxe, začaly více přibližovat výsledkům\r\npodobně „chudých“ soupeřů a naopak jejich bohatší soupeři jim svým\r\nvýkonem zase trochu odskočili - viz graf níže. Z toho mimo jiné vyplývá,\r\nže s tím, jak se stále více společností bude při řízení lidských zdrojů\r\nspoléhat na výstupy z HR analytiky, přestane být HR analytika nějakou\r\nzásadní konkurenční výhodou a stane se z ní něco, co organizaci “pouze”\r\numožní držet krok s konkurencí.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si průměrnou sumu mezd vyplácených jednotlivými týmy svým hráčům v letech 2002-2012 \r\nprumerna_suma_MezdHracu2 <- mzdyHracu %>%\r\n  filter(yearID > 2001 & yearID <= 2012) %>%\r\n  group_by(teamID) %>%\r\n  summarise(prumerna_suma_MezdHracu = sum(salary)/length(unique(yearID)))\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si pro jednotlivé týmy průměrný počet výher za sezónu v letech 2002-2012\r\nprumerny_pocet_vyher2 <- vyhryTymu %>%\r\n  filter(yearID > 2001 & yearID <=2012) %>%\r\n  group_by(teamID) %>%\r\n  summarise(prumerny_pocet_vyher = sum(W)/length(unique(yearID)))\r\n\r\n# Vyjádřeme si graficky vztah mezi počtem výher a množstvím peněz, které týmy vynakládají na mzdy svých hráčů \r\nprumerna_suma_MezdHracu2 %>%\r\n  left_join(prumerny_pocet_vyher2, \"teamID\") %>%\r\n  mutate(OAK = ifelse(teamID == \"OAK\", \"ano\", \"ne\")) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x= prumerna_suma_MezdHracu, y = prumerny_pocet_vyher, fill = OAK)) +\r\n  geom_point()+\r\n  ggtitle(\"Mzdy hráčů a počet vítězství v letech 2002-2012\")+\r\n  xlab(\"Průměrná suma mezd hráčů (USD)\")+\r\n  ylab(\"Průměrný počet výher za sezónu\")+\r\n  geom_label_repel(\r\n    aes(label = teamID),\r\n    box.padding = 0.25, point.padding = 0.25,\r\n    segment.color = 'grey50')+\r\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")+\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#ffd400\", \"#ffffff\"), \r\n                        labels = c(\"ano\",\"ne\")) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(65,100), breaks = seq(65,100,5)) +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(3e+07,2e+08), breaks = seq(3e+07,2e+08,2e+07))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZávěr\r\nNa příkladu oaklandského baseballového mužstva jsme takto mohli\r\nsledovat obvyklý postup aplikace HR analytiky na určitý druh problému,\r\nkterý se snaží v dané organizaci vyřešit. Vzhledem ke specifickému\r\npředmětu podnikání oaklandských „Áček“ bylo tímto cílem dosáhnout\r\npostupu do play-off a to v situaci, kdy management neměl dostatek\r\nfinančních prostředků na zaplacení hráčů považovaných dle tradičních\r\nměřítek za kvalitní a perspektivní. Od tohoto cíle se potom odvíjela\r\nřada kroků, které blíže specifikovaly jeho povahu a identifikovaly\r\nfaktory (mimo jiné i ty personální), které s jeho dosažením souvisí. Na\r\nzákladě této znalosti potom bylo možné formulovat určité předpovědi a\r\nučinit jistá rozhodnutí, která zvýšila pravděpodobnost toho, že se\r\npodaří vytčeného cíle dosáhnout. Přestože tento příběh o využití HR\r\nanalytiky se odehrál ve světě sportu, jeho logika je platná i v kontextu\r\ntradičnějšího typu organizací. Ostatně ve všech typech\r\norganizací jde nakonec především o to mít na správném místě a ve správný\r\nčas ty správné lidi - jedině tak tyto organizace mohou\r\nsystematicky dosahovat svých strategických cílů.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
