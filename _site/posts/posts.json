    "contents": "\r\nRecently, I experimented with zero-shot classification - a machine learning task where the model classifies data into categories it hasn’t encountered during training - to determine the sentiment of comments from an employee survey (positive, negative, mixed, neutral).\r\nI chose this approach as an alternative to the traditional lexicon and rule-based NLTK sentiment analyzer. Using the transformer architecture of the model (bart-large-mnli from Facebook), I aimed to capture context from entire comments when gauging their sentiment. I admit that I had some doubts because the model wasn’t specifically trained for sentiment analysis. Instead, it generalizes its understanding from the MNLI tasks to deduce sentiments.\r\nFortunately, each comment was tied to specific statements that also received ratings on a standard 0-10 scale. This allowed me to cross-reference the sentiment classification with the ratings people assigned to these statements.\r\nSo, how did the model do? As the attached chart shows, the average sentiment classification probability is pretty compellingly consistent with the ratings on the standard scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\n\r\nmydata <- readr::read_csv(\"./mydata.csv\")\r\n\r\nlabel_data <- mydata %>% \r\n  dplyr::group_by(sentiment_category) %>% \r\n  dplyr::slice(1)\r\n\r\nmydata %>% \r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Score, y = avg_sentiment_score, color = sentiment_category)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point(size = 3) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,NA), breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-1,10), breaks = seq(0,10,1)) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Mixed\"=\"#7b00e7\", \"Negative\"=\"#db370e\", \"Neutral\"=\"grey\", \"Positive\"=\"#208600\")) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_text(data=label_data, aes(label=sentiment_category), nudge_x=-0.5, hjust=0.75, vjust = 0, size = 5, fontface = \"bold\") +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    x = \"SURVEY ITEM RATING (0-10)\",\r\n    y = \"AVERAGE PROBABILITY OF SENTIMENT CATEGORY\",\r\n    title = \"Validation of zero-shot sentiment classification\",\r\n    color = \"\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    plot.title = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"bold\", size = 18, margin=margin(0,0,12,0)),\r\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 15, margin=margin(0,0,20,0)),\r\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 11, hjust = 0),\r\n    axis.title.x.bottom = element_text(margin = margin(t = 15, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0), color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 13, lineheight = 16, hjust = 0),\r\n    axis.title.y.left = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 15, b = 0, l = 0), color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 13, lineheight = 16, hjust = 1),\r\n    axis.text = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 12, lineheight = 16),\r\n    axis.line = element_line(colour = \"#E0E1E6\"),\r\n    axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"#E0E1E6\"),\r\n    strip.text.x = element_text(size = 11, face = \"plain\"),\r\n    legend.position= \"none\",\r\n    legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\r\n    legend.key.width = unit(1.6, \"line\"),\r\n    legend.margin = margin(0,0,0,0, unit=\"cm\"),\r\n    legend.text = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 10, lineheight = 16),\r\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\r\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\r\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\r\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\r\n    plot.margin=unit(c(5,5,5,5),\"mm\"), \r\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\r\n    plot.caption.position =  \"plot\"\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeems like I can add another useful tool to my toolbox.

Now, however, my time tends to be spread out between a series of 30-45 minute long meetings that help me navigate a complex organization like Sanofi, explore opportunities for collaboration, and make valuable contacts that can help me deliver on tasks in the future.\r\n\r\nIllustration of the Maker’s vs. Manager’s schedule.\r\nI wondered if I could gain any potentially useful insights from this particular “intuition pump”. I took the help of the book “Algorithms to Live By” by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths and found at least five such insights:\r\nAlthough one has a primary mode of operation (e.g. exploitation for makers, exploration for managers), one should not completely ignore the other mode and should allocate a small, consistent portion of one’s time to ensure that one does not miss valuable insights or opportunities that lie outside one’s primary mode of operation (based on the Epsilon-Greedy strategy to solve the Multi-Armed Bandit problem).\r\nOver time, as one becomes more aware of the options available, the need for exploration may decrease, allowing for more targeted exploitation of known best opportunities (based on the Decaying Epsilon strategy to solve the Multi-Armed Bandit problem).\r\nAlthough our primary focus is on delivery, we should remain open and try new options that have the highest potential upside, despite the associated high uncertainty (based on the Upper Confidence Bound strategy to solution of the Multi-Armed Bandit problem).\r\nIf you plan to stay with the company for a while, you should be open to further exploration, as newly found valuable opportunities can be used later in the future, and vice versa (btw, this could be a useful signal of intentions to leave, as some research suggests that people actually tend to resolve this type of trade-offs this way).\r\nBe Bayesian, i.e., choose your paths based on your current beliefs, regularly check the balance between exploration and exploitation on your calendar, and update your beliefs and make new, more informed decisions as evidence of outcomes accumulates (based on the Thompson Sampling strategy to solution of the Multi-Armed Bandit problem).\r\nMaybe you’ll find some of these insights helpful in finding a better balance between exploring new paths and following familiar ones, leading to more effective use of your time. If nothing else, take this as a recommendation to read the book mentioned above - there’s plenty in there for inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nOne of the advantages of doing statistical analysis in a Bayesian framework is that its generative part makes it a natural fit for business process simulation, which incorporates all the uncertainties inherent in the statistical models we use to capture the patterns of interest.\r\nOnce the parameters of the models have been estimated, their corresponding posterior distributions can be easily sampled and used in combination with a range of input values to simulate the expected outcomes, including the associated uncertainty that needs to be taken into account when making decisions.\r\nTo illustrate, imagine, for example, that as a CHRO you want to estimate the number of potential new employees brought in by employees who choose to participate in a new referral program. Fortunately, you have data from a small, three-month pilot of this program in which you offered participation to a small random sample of employees. Using a combination of simple Binomial and Poisson models, you can easily arrive at a reasonable estimate of the outcome of interest when you introduce the program to a larger portion of the company.\r\nLets’ implement this simple illustrative example with PyMC, a probabilistic programming library for Python that allows users to build Bayesian models with a simple Python API and fit them using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.\r\nFirst, let’s upload the data from the pilot program. The first table includes 150 employees who were randomly selected and offered participation in the pilot program. The second table then shows 42 employees who chose to participate in the program and the number of potential new employees they brought in.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n# table with all pilot nominees\r\nnominees=pd.read_excel(\"./dataBayesSim.xlsx\", sheet_name=\"nominees\")\r\n\r\n# table with all pilot participants\r\nparticipants=pd.read_excel(\"./dataBayesSim.xlsx\", sheet_name=\"participants\")\r\n\r\n# showing first few rows of the tables\r\nnominees.head(5)\r\n  employeeID  participation\r\n0         e1              0\r\n1         e2              0\r\n2         e3              0\r\n3         e4              0\r\n4         e5              0\r\n\r\nShow code\r\nparticipants.head(5)\r\n  employeeID  referrals\r\n0         e7          2\r\n1         e9          4\r\n2        e10          2\r\n3        e11          2\r\n4        e25          1\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the expected number of new potential employees after the introduction of a new referral program to a larger part of the company, we want to model the probability that nominees actually participate in the program and the expected number of potential candidates that a participant brings in. To do this, we can fit Binomial and Poisson models to the data, respectively. As mentioned above, we will do this in a Bayesian framework that will make it easier to deal with uncertainty later in our simulation. A side note: for the sake of brevity, I omit the usual sanity checks that should be performed before drawing any conclusions from fitted models - e.g., checking for convergence of Markov chains or posterior predictive checks for how well the fitted models predict observed data.\r\nLet’s start with the first model. From the summary below, we see that the estimated probability of participating in the programme is between 0.21 and 0.35.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\nimport pymc as pm\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n# estimating the participation rate\r\nnominated = nominees.shape[0]\r\nparticipated = nominees['participation'].sum()\r\n\r\n# setting up the model\r\nwith pm.Model() as participationModel:\r\n  # assigning a flat Beta prior for p\r\n  p = pm.Beta(\"p\", alpha=1, beta=1)\r\n  \r\n  # defining likelihood\r\n  obs = pm.Binomial(\"obs\", p=p, n=nominated, observed=participated)\r\n  \r\n  # running mcmc\r\n  idata = pm.sample(3000, tune=500, chains=3, cores=1)\r\n  \r\n  # generating posterior predictive sample\r\n  participationModelPosterior = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(idata, extend_inferencedata=True)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\nimport arviz as az\r\n\r\n# trace plot showing the evolution of parameter vector over the iterations of Markov chain(s)\r\n#az.plot_trace(idata, kind=\"trace\", divergences=\"bottom\", show=True)\r\n\r\n# posterior predictive check\r\n#az.plot_ppc(participationModelPosterior, num_pp_samples=500, random_seed=7, alpha=0.3, textsize=14, kind='kde', show=True)\r\n\r\n# tabular and visual summary of the posterior probability distribution of the p parameter value\r\naz.summary(idata).round(2)\r\n   mean    sd  hdi_3%  hdi_97%  mcse_mean  mcse_sd  ess_bulk  ess_tail  r_hat\r\np  0.28  0.04    0.22     0.35        0.0      0.0    4338.0    6229.0    1.0\r\n\r\nShow code\r\naz.plot_posterior(idata, hdi_prob=.95, show=True)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second model then suggests that program participants brought in an average of 1.7 to 2.5 referrals.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n# setting up the Poisson model\r\nwith pm.Model() as referralModel:\r\n  # weakly informative exponential prior for lambda parameter with mean 3\r\n  lambda_ = pm.Exponential('lambda', 1/3)\r\n  # alternative flat prior for lambda parameter\r\n  #lambda_ = pm.Uniform('lambda', lower=0, upper=25)\r\n  \r\n  # Poisson likelihood\r\n  y_obs = pm.Poisson('y_obs', mu=lambda_, observed=participants['referrals'])\r\n  \r\n  # running mcmc\r\n  trace = pm.sample(3000, tune=500, chains=3, cores=1)\r\n  \r\n  # generating posterior predictive sample\r\n  referralModelPosterior = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, extend_inferencedata=True)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n# trace plot showing the evolution of parameter vector over the iterations of Markov chain(s)\r\n#az.plot_trace(trace, kind=\"trace\", divergences=\"bottom\", show=True)\r\n\r\n# posterior predictive check\r\n#az.plot_ppc(referralModelPosterior, num_pp_samples=500, random_seed=7, alpha=0.3, textsize=14, kind='kde', show=True)\r\n\r\n# tabular and visual summary of the posterior probability distribution of the p parameter value\r\naz.summary(trace).round(2)\r\n        mean    sd  hdi_3%  hdi_97%  ...  mcse_sd  ess_bulk  ess_tail  r_hat\r\nlambda   2.1  0.22    1.69     2.51  ...      0.0    3676.0    6056.0    1.0\r\n\r\n[1 rows x 9 columns]\r\n\r\nShow code\r\naz.plot_posterior(trace, hdi_prob=.95, show=True)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can now sample the posterior distributions of the parameters p and lambda, insert them into the dataframe, and for each row/combination calculate the expected number of referrals brought in by participating employees when the program is rolled out to the entire population of 1500 employees. As you can see below, using the IQR, our CHRO can expect recruiters to reach 790 to 990 potential candidates once the new company-wide referral program is in place.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport seaborn as sns\r\nsns.set_theme(style=\"white\")\r\n\r\n# sampling from the posterior distribution the parameters p and lambda\r\nposterior = pd.DataFrame({\r\n    'p': idata['posterior']['p'].values.flatten(),\r\n    'lambda': trace['posterior']['lambda'].values.flatten()\r\n})\r\n\r\n# computing expected number of referrals with 1500 nominees\r\nposterior['expectedReferrals'] = 1500*posterior['p']*posterior['lambda']\r\n\r\n# computing summary statistics\r\nm = posterior['expectedReferrals'].mean().round(1)\r\nQ1 = np.percentile(posterior['expectedReferrals'], 25).round(1)\r\nQ2 = np.percentile(posterior['expectedReferrals'], 50).round(1)\r\nQ3 = np.percentile(posterior['expectedReferrals'], 75).round(1)\r\n\r\n# visualizing results\r\nsns.histplot(posterior['expectedReferrals'], bins=30, kde=True, color='#5b7db6').set(xlabel =\"Number of new referrals\", ylabel = \"Count\")\r\nplt.gcf().suptitle('Expected referrals for program rollout to all 1500 employees', fontsize=13)\r\nplt.gca().set_title(f'Mean={m}, Q1={Q1}, Median={Q2}, Q3={Q3}', fontsize=10)\r\nplt.show()\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it doesn’t have to end there. For example, this estimate can be combined with other inputs, e.g. the cost of a new referral program, the cost of an alternative solution, etc., to make a better informed decision, taking into account the existing uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

One of the lessons I took away from this study so far is that no matter how fancy the ML algorithm we use, without a plausible model of the data-generating process, we cannot hope for an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect as without it, it is difficult to select relevant covariates and avoid those that introduce bias into our estimation (e.g. colliders, mediators and their descendants).\r\nTo illustrate and reinforce this lesson for myself, I coded a small example of estimating the average treatment effect of training performance on productivity using synthetic data with a known data-generating process and the Double ML method.\r\nFirst, we create a DAG of the causal relationships behind our data. We see that, according to this DAG, employee productivity is affected by years of experience, job fit, available resources, and training performance, which is our variable of interest. Employee satisfaction is also part of the DAG, which is affected by available resources, employee productivity, and training performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nimport networkx as nx\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\n# initializing DAG\r\nG = nx.DiGraph()\r\n\r\n# adding nodes\r\nnodes = ['Years of experience', 'Resources', 'Job_fit', 'Training', 'Productivity', 'Satisfaction', 'Cognitive ability']\r\nG.add_nodes_from(nodes)\r\n\r\n# adding edges\r\nedges = [('Years of experience', 'Productivity'),\r\n         ('Cognitive ability', 'Productivity'),\r\n         ('Cognitive ability', 'Training'),\r\n         ('Resources', 'Productivity'),\r\n         ('Resources', 'Satisfaction'),\r\n         ('Job_fit', 'Productivity'),\r\n         ('Training', 'Productivity'),\r\n         ('Training', 'Satisfaction'),\r\n         ('Productivity', 'Satisfaction')]\r\n\r\nG.add_edges_from(edges)\r\n\r\n# drawing DAG\r\npos = nx.fruchterman_reingold_layout(G, seed=5, iterations = 500, k = 2)\r\nlabels = {node: node for node in G.nodes()}\r\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, labels=labels, node_color='lightblue', font_weight='bold', node_size=1500, font_size=10)\r\nplt.title(\"DAG\")\r\nplt.show()\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let’s generate synthetic data corresponding to this DAG.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n# generating synthetic data\r\nnp.random.seed(42)\r\nn = 1000\r\n\r\n# generating features years of experience, resources, job fit, and cognitive ability\r\nX = np.random.normal(0, 1, (n, 4))\r\n\r\n# setting the true causal effect of training performance \r\ntrue_causal_effect = 3.5\r\n\r\n# training is influence by cognitive ability\r\ntraining = 1.8 * X[:, 3] + np.random.normal(0, 1, n)\r\n\r\n# productivity is influenced by all features \r\nproductivity = 2 * X[:, 0] + 1 * X[:, 1] + 0.5 * X[:, 2] + 2.2 * X[:, 3] + true_causal_effect * training + np.random.normal(0, 1, n)\r\n\r\n# defining an employee satisfaction variable that is influenced by resources, productivity, and training\r\nsatisfaction = 0.3 * X[:, 1] +  0.2 * productivity + 1.3 * training + np.random.normal(0, 1, n)\r\n\r\n# creating a final dataFrame\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=['years_of_experience', 'resources', 'job_fit', 'cognitive_ability'])\r\ndf['training'] = training\r\ndf['productivity'] = productivity\r\ndf['satisfaction'] = satisfaction \r\n\r\nWithout DAG, i.e., without understanding the data-generating process behind our data, we might be tempted to “throw” all available variables into our estimator. We can give it a try and use Double ML for that - a popular framework designed to provide unbiased and consistent estimates of treatment effects in the presence of high-dimensional controls while reducing the risk of overfitting. The common Double ML procedure looks as follows:\r\nRandomly splitting the data into two parts: one for estimating the control function and the other for estimating the treatment effect.\r\nUsing the first part of the data to train a machine learning model to predict the outcome variable based on covariates (without the treatment variable). Similarly, training another model to predict the treatment variable based on covariates.\r\nUsing the second part of the data to form the residuals for outcome and treatment variable and running a simple linear regression of outcome residuals on treatment residuals.\r\nRepeating steps 1-3 but switching the roles of the two data splits and averaging the estimates to get the final average treatment estimate.\r\nLet’s apply this approach to our data and use XGBoost models to estimate the control function and see how successful we will be in our efforts to estimate the known causal effect of training on productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom xgboost import XGBRegressor\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\r\n\r\n# creating a variable for data splits\r\nnp.random.seed(42)\r\ndf['part'] = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=len(df))\r\n\r\nestimates = []\r\n\r\nfor p in [0,1]:\r\n    \r\n    # auxiliary variables for switching the roles of the two data splits\r\n    firstPart = 1-p\r\n    secondPart = p-0\r\n    \r\n    # used covariates\r\n    covariates = ['years_of_experience', 'resources', 'job_fit', 'cognitive_ability', 'satisfaction']\r\n  \r\n    # preparing datasets\r\n    X_First = df.loc[df['part'] == firstPart, covariates].values\r\n    y_Outcome_First = df.loc[df['part'] == firstPart,'productivity'].values\r\n    y_Treatment_First = df.loc[df['part'] == firstPart,'training'].values\r\n    \r\n    X_Second = df.loc[df['part'] == secondPart, covariates].values\r\n    y_Outcome_Second = df.loc[df['part'] == secondPart,'productivity'].values\r\n    y_Treatment_Second = df.loc[df['part'] == secondPart,'training'].values\r\n    \r\n    # controlling for covariates for productivity using XGBoost\r\n    model_Outcome = XGBRegressor(eta = 0.1, n_estimators =25)\r\n    model_Outcome.fit(X_First, y_Outcome_First)\r\n    residual_Outcome = y_Outcome_Second - model_Outcome.predict(X_Second)\r\n    \r\n    # controlling for covariates for training using XGBoost\r\n    model_Treatment = XGBRegressor(eta = 0.1, n_estimators =25)\r\n    model_Treatment.fit(X_First, y_Treatment_First)\r\n    residual_Treatment = y_Treatment_Second - model_Treatment.predict(X_Second)\r\n    \r\n    # Part 3: Estimate the causal effect using the residuals with Linear Regression\r\n    model_causal = LinearRegression()\r\n    model_causal.fit(residual_Treatment.reshape(-1, 1), residual_Outcome)\r\n    double_ml_effect = model_causal.coef_[0]\r\n    \r\n    estimates.append(double_ml_effect)\r\n  \r\nLinearRegression()In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

How so? Well, if you look at the DAG above, you can see that by using all the variables as covariates, not only have we correctly blocked the backdoor by controlling for employee cognitive ability, but we have also introduced bias into our estimation by controlling for satisfaction, which is a collider - a variable that is affected by both the outcome (productivity) and the treatment (training). And controlling for colliders leads to spurious correlations between variables or, as in our case, deflates the size of the estimated effect. We can easily check this using DAGitty, which is a wonderful browser-based environment for creating and analysing causal diagrams.\r\n\r\nSo let’s repeat the estimation, but now without satisfaction variable as covariate. As you can see below, we are now much closer to the actual causal effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# creating a variable for data splits\r\nnp.random.seed(42)\r\ndf['part'] = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=len(df))\r\n\r\nestimates = []\r\n\r\nfor p in [0,1]:\r\n    \r\n    # auxiliary variables for switching the roles of the two data splits\r\n    firstPart = 1-p\r\n    secondPart = p-0\r\n    \r\n    # used covariates\r\n    covariates = ['years_of_experience', 'resources', 'job_fit', 'cognitive_ability']\r\n  \r\n    # preparing datasets\r\n    X_First = df.loc[df['part'] == firstPart, covariates].values\r\n    y_Outcome_First = df.loc[df['part'] == firstPart,'productivity'].values\r\n    y_Treatment_First = df.loc[df['part'] == firstPart,'training'].values\r\n    \r\n    X_Second = df.loc[df['part'] == secondPart, covariates].values\r\n    y_Outcome_Second = df.loc[df['part'] == secondPart,'productivity'].values\r\n    y_Treatment_Second = df.loc[df['part'] == secondPart,'training'].values\r\n    \r\n    # controlling for covariates for productivity using XGBoost\r\n    model_Outcome = XGBRegressor(eta = 0.1, n_estimators =25)\r\n    model_Outcome.fit(X_First, y_Outcome_First)\r\n    residual_Outcome = y_Outcome_Second - model_Outcome.predict(X_Second)\r\n    \r\n    # controlling for covariates for training using XGBoost\r\n    model_Treatment = XGBRegressor(eta = 0.1, n_estimators =25)\r\n    model_Treatment.fit(X_First, y_Treatment_First)\r\n    residual_Treatment = y_Treatment_Second - model_Treatment.predict(X_Second)\r\n    \r\n    # Part 3: Estimate the causal effect using the residuals with Linear Regression\r\n    model_causal = LinearRegression()\r\n    model_causal.fit(residual_Treatment.reshape(-1, 1), residual_Outcome)\r\n    double_ml_effect = model_causal.coef_[0]\r\n    \r\n    estimates.append(double_ml_effect)\r\n  \r\nLinearRegression()In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

First, we need to train the model. I suppose you know the drill and know all the steps to go through to get a useful and reliable model. The following R script implements the whole process of data preparation, (XGBoost) model tuning, training, and validation.

We use the testing data as a new dataset that we will score by the trained model and show stakeholders how the predicted flight risk varies by department, job role, and gender.\r\nFirst, we should check in the PBI settings that PBI has access to our R (or Python) instance (File -> Options and setting -> GLOBAL/R scripting/Python scripting). If so, we can upload new data using the Get data dialog and go to the Transform tab in the Query editor. Here, we should first check that the data types match those in R when preparing the model, and then we can load and run our scoring algorithm using the Run R script dialog. The following script will do the job.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# 'dataset' holds the input data for this script\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(workflows)\r\n\r\n# uploading trained model\r\nmodel <- readRDS(\"PathTo/YourModel.RDS\")\r\n\r\n# generate predictions\r\nprediction <- predict(model, dataset) %>% \r\n  dplyr::bind_cols(predict(model, dataset, type = \"prob\")) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(\r\n    predictedCat = .pred_class,\r\n    probLeave = .pred_1,\r\n    probStay = .pred_0\r\n  )\r\n\r\n# enriching original dataset\r\nprediction <- cbind(dataset, prediction)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter running the script, our original data will be enriched with the generated predictions. We can apply this transformation, save it and exit the Query editor using the Close & Apply button. We will then have flight risk predictions that we can visualize along with the original data, allowing us to see how predicted flight risk varies by department, job role, and gender, among other things. Again, we could use R or Python for this purpose, as PBI does not offer some types of data visualization by default, especially those related to visualizing data variability. For example, to create the raincloud plots below, I used the ggplot2 and ggdist packages in R. Below is a script used within the R visual that implements one of the plots. To fine-tune them, I recommend using RStudio (if you have it on your computer), which is accessible directly from the R visual editor in PBI.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# 'dataset' holds the input data for this script\r\n# dataset <- data.frame(probLeave, Department)\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(ggdist)\r\n\r\ndataset %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(Department, probLeave, mean, .na_rm = TRUE), y = probLeave)) + \r\n  ggdist::stat_halfeye(\r\n    adjust = .5, \r\n    width = .6, \r\n    .width = 0, \r\n    justification = -.3, \r\n    point_colour = NA,\r\n    fill = \"#bca36b\",\r\n    color = \"#bca36b\"\r\n  ) + \r\n  ggplot2::geom_boxplot(\r\n    width = .25, \r\n    outlier.shape = NA\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom=\"point\", shape=20, size=5, color=\"#bca36b\", fill=\"#bca36b\") +\r\n  geom_point(\r\n    size = 1.3,\r\n    alpha = .3,\r\n    position = position_jitter(seed = 1, width = .09, height = .008\r\n    )\r\n  ) + \r\n  ggplot2::coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1.2, NA), clip = \"off\") +\r\n  ggplot2::coord_flip() +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    x = \"\",\r\n    y = \"PROBABILITY OF LEAVING\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(plot.title = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"bold\", size = 18, margin=margin(0,0,12,0)),\r\n                 plot.subtitle = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 16, margin=margin(0,0,20,0)),\r\n                 plot.caption = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 11, hjust = 0),\r\n                 axis.title.x.bottom = element_text(margin = margin(t = 15, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0), color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 13, lineheight = 16, hjust = 0),\r\n                 axis.title.y.left = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 15, b = 0, l = 0), color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 13, lineheight = 16, hjust = 1),\r\n                 axis.text.x = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 12, lineheight = 16),\r\n                 axis.text.y = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 12, lineheight = 16),\r\n                 strip.text.x = element_text(size = 11, face = \"plain\"),\r\n                 axis.line.x = element_line(colour = \"#E0E1E6\"),\r\n                 axis.line.y = element_blank(),\r\n                 legend.position=c(.95,.88),\r\n                 legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\r\n                 legend.key.width = unit(1.6, \"line\"),\r\n                 legend.margin = margin(-0.8,0,0,0, unit=\"cm\"),\r\n                 legend.text = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 10, lineheight = 16),\r\n                 panel.background = element_blank(),\r\n                 panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\r\n                 panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\r\n                 panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\r\n                 axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = \"#E0E1E6\"),\r\n                 axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\r\n                 plot.margin=unit(c(0,0,0,0),\"mm\"), \r\n                 plot.title.position = \"plot\",\r\n                 plot.caption.position =  \"plot\"\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may also want to allow dashboard users to enter custom values for specific personas of interest and let the scoring algorithm predict the corresponding risk of leaving the company. To make the demonstration of this feature somewhat easier, I will use a different prediction model that uses only some of the strongest predictors.\r\nTo enable this feature, we need to create several parameters that the user can set. For numeric predictors we can use the New parameter dialog box on the Modeling tab - we set the name of the parameters, their data type, their minimum, maximum, and default values, and confirm we want to show corresponding sliders in the dashboard. For categorical parameters, we need to create and then upload a table with all possible combinations of values of the categorical parameters used. When using R, we can use for example the expand.grid function to do this. The fields from this table are then used and displayed in the dashboard as single-selection filters. And all these parameters then serve as input to the R visual, where we load the model, change the names of some parameters to match those expected by the model, generate a prediction, and create the resulting visualization. All these steps are implemented by the following R script.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# 'dataset' holds the input data for this script\r\n# dataset <- data.frame(JobLevelParameter Value, YearsWithCurrManagerParameter Value, OverTime, Department, JobSatisfaction)\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(workflows)\r\n\r\ndata <- dataset %>%\r\n    dplyr::rename(\r\n        JobLevel = `JobLevelParameter Value`, \r\n        YearsWithCurrManager = `YearsWithCurrManagerParameter Value`\r\n    )\r\n\r\n# uploading trained model\r\nmodel <- readRDS(\"PathTo/YourModel2.RDS\")\r\n\r\n# generate predictions\r\nprediction <- predict(model, data) %>% \r\n  dplyr::bind_cols(predict(model, data, type = \"prob\")) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(\r\n    predictedCat = .pred_class,\r\n    probLeave = .pred_1,\r\n    probStay = .pred_0\r\n  )\r\n\r\n# enriching original dataset\r\nprediction <- cbind(data, prediction)\r\n\r\nprediction %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = probLeave)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#444492\") +\r\n  ggplot2::coord_flip() +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_text(aes(label = round(probLeave, 2)), nudge_y = 0.04, color = \"black\", size = 7, fontface = \"bold\") +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1.08), breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +\r\n  labs(\r\n    x = \"\",\r\n    y = \"PROBABILITY OF LEAVING\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(plot.title = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"bold\", size = 18, margin=margin(0,0,12,0)),\r\n                 plot.subtitle = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 16, margin=margin(0,0,20,0)),\r\n                 plot.caption = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 11, hjust = 0),\r\n                 axis.title.x.bottom = element_text(margin = margin(t = 15, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0), color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 13, lineheight = 16, hjust = 0),\r\n                 axis.title.y.left = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 15, b = 0, l = 0), color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 13, lineheight = 16, hjust = 1),\r\n                 axis.text.x = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 12, lineheight = 16),\r\n                 axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n                 strip.text.x = element_text(size = 11, face = \"plain\"),\r\n                 axis.line.x = element_line(colour = \"#E0E1E6\"),\r\n                 axis.line.y = element_blank(),\r\n                 legend.position=c(.95,.88),\r\n                 legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\r\n                 legend.key.width = unit(1.6, \"line\"),\r\n                 legend.margin = margin(-0.8,0,0,0, unit=\"cm\"),\r\n                 legend.text = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 10, lineheight = 16),\r\n                 panel.background = element_blank(),\r\n                 panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\r\n                 panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\r\n                 panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\r\n                 axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = \"#E0E1E6\"),\r\n                 axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\r\n                 plot.margin=unit(c(0,0,0,0),\"mm\"), \r\n                 plot.title.position = \"plot\",\r\n                 plot.caption.position =  \"plot\"\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis completed the work on our local computer. You can download the final dashboard here. If you use it, be sure to update the paths to the trained model in both the Query Editor and the R visuals. The next step is to set up the Power BI Service and install and configure the on-premises data gateway so that the R scripts will work in dashboards shared with others. More on this in a future blog post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nWhile reading the excellent publication Social Networks at Work from SIOP’s Organizational Frontiers series (btw, highly recommended to all PA professionals), I came across the interesting and useful concept of induced centrality.\r\nIt sort of reverses the logic of the common ONA centrality measures, which focus primarily on what one gets from the surrounding network of connections, and instead shows how individual nodes contribute to some global network characteristic of interest, i.e. what one does for the network as a whole.\r\nIts calculation is quite simple and straightforward - you just need to first calculate the global characteristic of the network that you are interested in as a reference point, e.g. its coherence, and then calculate how this measure changes when you remove individual nodes from the network. From this, you can deduce that the nodes that cause the most change in a specific direction contribute the most to a given measure.\r\nIn addition to its versatility and the interesting angle it offers, it can also be very useful in making visible otherwise hidden and invisible “heroes” who contribute to the greater good under the radar of public recognition.\r\nWhat follows is a small demonstration of using induced centrality to estimate which people play the role of expressive leaders who shorten the lengths of paths in the network. It’s an implementation of the idea briefly described in the aforementioned publication Social Networks at Work:\r\n“For example, suppose one theorizes that there are certain individuals in groups (perhaps called expressive leaders) who provide a certain social glue such that they tend to shorten the lengths of paths in the network (see, for example, the Heidi Roizen case by McGinn and Tempest, 2010). This sounds like we should use closeness centrality, since it is concerned with path lengths. But there are two problems with this. First of all, closeness centrality only counts the shortest paths, and not the circuitous paths that things such as gossip often take. Second, closeness gets at how long it takes for information to reach a given node, who is then presumed to benefit from this information. But the concept we’ve just outlined is about individuals who enable others to have short paths so that the whole group benefits. Closeness was not designed to measure this, and doesn’t. However an induced centrality measure can be created to measure exactly this: to what degree paths lengthen when you remove each node from the network.”\r\nFirst, let’s upload the data used for the demonstration and create the network object. I will use a dataset that captures information-sharing links between 15 members of my friendship network.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(readxl)\r\nlibrary(igraph)\r\nlibrary(ggraph)\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\ndf <- readxl::read_excel(\"./friendshipNetwork.xlsx\")\r\n\r\n# creating network object\r\ng <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(df, directed=TRUE) \r\n\r\n\r\nWe can now iterate over all directed pairs of nodes and compute the average length of paths between nodes we will use as a reference point. We won’t use all the paths but only the three shortest paths between each pair of nodes that would enable us to capture some of the circuitous paths mentioned in the problem description above.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nall_nodes <- V(g)\r\ntotal_length <- 0\r\ntotal_paths <- 0\r\n# setting the number of 3 shortest paths between pair of nodes to capture also some of the circuitous paths \r\ntop_shortest_paths <- 3\r\n\r\n# loop for directed network\r\nfor (i in 1:length(all_nodes)) {\r\n  for (j in 1:length(all_nodes)) {\r\n    if (i != j) {\r\n      lengths <- unlist(igraph::all_simple_paths(g, all_nodes[i], all_nodes[j], mode = \"out\"))\r\n      lengths <- sort(lengths, decreasing = FALSE)[1:top_shortest_paths]\r\n      total_length <- total_length + sum(lengths, na.rm = TRUE)\r\n      total_paths <- total_paths + length(lengths)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# loop for undirected network \r\n# for (i in 1:(length(all_nodes) - 1)) {\r\n#   for (j in (i + 1):length(all_nodes)) {\r\n#     lengths <- all_simple_paths(g, all_nodes[i], all_nodes[j])\r\n#     lengths <- sort(lengths, decreasing = FALSE)[1:top_shortest_paths]\r\n#     total_length <- total_length + sum(lengths, na.rm = TRUE)\r\n#     total_paths <- total_paths + length(lengths)\r\n#   }\r\n# }\r\n\r\n# computing the average length of paths\r\naverage_length_ref <- total_length / total_paths\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let’s remove each node one at a time from the network and calculate the average lengths of paths between pairs consisting of the remaining nodes. We also need to deal somehow with situations when node removal leads to the disconnection of previously connected nodes (in such situations, the distance between nodes is by default assumed to be infinite or undefined, which would bias our estimation). I have decided to take the three shortest paths from the complete network and add 1 (this is somewhat equivalent to the additional effort required to find a new bonding connection). After this step, we can subtract the reference point from the obtained values and get the information about the absence of which nodes lengthens the paths between other nodes and thus act as a kind of social glue that facilitates the spread of information between nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# vector for saving average lengths of paths for individual nodes\r\naverage_lengths <- numeric(length(all_nodes))\r\n\r\nfor (k in 1:length(all_nodes)) {\r\n\r\n  g_new <- g\r\n  g_new <- igraph::delete_vertices(g_new, all_nodes[k])\r\n  all_nodes_new <- V(g_new)\r\n  \r\n  total_length_new <- 0\r\n  total_paths_new <- 0\r\n  \r\n  # for directed network\r\n  for (i in 1:length(all_nodes_new)) {\r\n    for (j in 1:length(all_nodes_new)) {\r\n      if (i != j) {\r\n        # lengths of paths in the network with removed node \r\n        lengths_new <- unlist(igraph::all_simple_paths(g_new, all_nodes_new[i], all_nodes_new[j], mode=\"out\"))\r\n        # lengths of paths in the complete network\r\n        lengths <- unlist(igraph::all_simple_paths(g, all_nodes_new[i]$name, all_nodes_new[j]$name, mode=\"out\"))\r\n        # dealing with situations when node removal leads to disconnection of previously connected nodes by taking 3 shortest paths from the full network and adding 1\r\n        if(is.null(lengths_new) & !is.null(lengths)){\r\n          lengths_new <- sort(lengths, decreasing = FALSE)[1:top_shortest_paths]\r\n          lengths_new <- lengths_new + 1\r\n        } else{\r\n          lengths_new <- sort(lengths_new, decreasing = FALSE)[1:top_shortest_paths]\r\n        }\r\n        total_length_new <- total_length_new + sum(lengths_new, na.rm = TRUE)\r\n        total_paths_new <- total_paths_new + length(lengths_new)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  # for undirected network \r\n  # for (i in 1:(length(all_nodes_new) -

    "contents": "\r\nIt’s a no-brainer that when comparing team performance on retention, the departure of one person in small teams with fewer members will have a more significant impact on turnover rates than it does in larger teams. However, this creates room for potential misinterpretation and inadequate actions.\r\nIt’s related to the well-known phenomenon of variation being more likely in smaller samples. Fans of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky will probably recall the famous cognitive bias of insensitivity to sample size which occurs when people judge the probability of obtaining a statistic regardless of sample size.\r\nOne way to reduce this effect is Bayesian shrinkage. This approach, which serves as a kind of regularization, involves borrowing information from the overall company turnover rate to influence the turnover rate of smaller teams. It works by “shrinking” the turnover rate of smaller teams towards the company average, and thus creating a balance between the observed rate and the company average.\r\nIt’s not dissimilar to what one intuitively does when deciding what movie to watch or what restaurant to go to, when movies and restaurants vary widely in the number of ratings available.\r\nYou can see this approach in action on the chart below. The smaller the team and the further its turnover rate is from the company-wide turnover rate (the vertical dashed line), the more the turnover rate estimate for that team is shifted towards the company-wide value (the distance between the red cross and the black dot) - see, for example, teams 4 and 6. For comparison, check teams 12 and 9 that don’t show much of a shrinkage effect due to the big size and small distance from the company-wide turnover rate, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading the necessary libraries\r\nlibrary(tidyverse) # data manipulation and dataviz\r\nlibrary(brms) # bayesian stats\r\nlibrary(cmdstanr) # bayesian stats\r\nlibrary(ggdist) # dataviz\r\n\r\n# creating artificial data\r\n# setting a seed for reproducibility\r\nset.seed(123)\r\n# number of teams\r\nnTeams <- 12\r\n# generating team sizes ranging from 10 to 100\r\nteamSizes <- sample(10:100, nTeams, replace = TRUE)\r\n# generating 'true' turnover rates from a beta distribution\r\ntrueRates <- rbeta(nTeams, 2, 10)\r\n# for each team, simulating the number of employees who left\r\nnumberLeft <- rbinom(nTeams, teamSizes, trueRates)\r\n# generating team IDs\r\nteamId <- as.character(1:nTeams)\r\n# creating the data frame\r\nteamsData <- data.frame(teamId, teamSizes, numberLeft)\r\n\r\n# fitting multilevel Bayesian logistic regression with wide, uninformative priors\r\nmodel <- brms::brm(\r\n  numberLeft | trials(teamSizes) ~ 1 + (1 | teamId),\r\n  data = teamsData,\r\n  family = binomial(link = \"logit\"),\r\n  prior = prior(normal(0, 10), class = \"Intercept\"),\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  iter = 5000,\r\n  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95),\r\n  seed = 123,\r\n  backend = \"cmdstanr\",\r\n  refresh = 0,\r\n  silent = 2 \r\n)\r\n\r\n# model summary\r\n#summary(model)\r\n#fixef(model)\r\n#ranef(model)\r\n\r\n# extracting the posterior samples\r\n#parnames(model)\r\nposteriorDraws <- as_draws_df(model, variable = \"Intercept\", regex = TRUE) %>%\r\n  dplyr::select(-.draw, -.chain, -.iteration, -sd_teamId__Intercept) %>%\r\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -b_Intercept, names_to = \"teamId\", values_to = \"paramValues\") %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    teamId = stringr::str_extract(teamId, \"\\\\d+\"),\r\n    team = stringr::str_glue(\"Team {teamId}\"),\r\n    logOdds = paramValues + b_Intercept,\r\n    estimatedTR = exp(logOdds) / (1 + exp(logOdds))\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::left_join(teamsData %>% dplyr::select(teamId, teamSizes), by = \"teamId\") %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    team = stringr::str_glue(\"{team} (n={teamSizes})\"),\r\n    team = forcats::fct_reorder(factor(team), as.numeric(teamId))\r\n    )\r\n\r\n# computing fixed, population-level effect estimate\r\nfixedEffect <- 1 / (1 + exp(-1*fixef(model)[1]))\r\n\r\n# computing observed turnover rate by team\r\nobservedRT <- teamsData %>% \r\n  dplyr::mutate(team = stringr::str_glue(\"Team {teamId}\")) %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    observedRT = numberLeft/teamSizes,\r\n    team = stringr::str_glue(\"{team} (n={teamSizes})\"),\r\n    team = forcats::fct_reorder(factor(team), as.numeric(teamId))\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# dataviz\r\nggplot2::ggplot(data = posteriorDraws, aes(x=estimatedTR, group = team)) + \r\n  ggdist::stat_halfeye(.width = c(0.8, 0.95), point_interval = \"median_hdi\", fill = \"skyblue\", normalize = \"groups\") +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point(data = observedRT, aes(x = observedRT, y = 0, group = team), color = \"red\", inherit.aes = F, size = 2.5, shape=3, stroke = 1.5) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = fixedEffect, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"#2C2F46\") +\r\n  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~team, ncol = 2) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    y = \"NORMALIZED DENSITY\",\r\n    x = \"ESTIMATED TURNOVER RATE\",\r\n    title = \"Using Bayesian shrinkage in reporting employee turnover\",\r\n    caption = \"\\nThe black solid lines represent the 80% and 95% credibility intervals, respectively.

Compared to other methods used in this context, such as Factor Analysis, k-means, or hierarchical clustering, it has several advantages:\r\nLCA can handle well categorical observed variables.\r\nLCA estimates probabilities of class membership, so it inherently incorporates uncertainty about which class each individual belongs to.\r\nLCA allows for meaningful analysis of missing answers or non-answers together with proper answers on a Likert scale.\r\nLCA provides a framework (via information criteria like BIC, AIC, or likelihood ratio tests) for comparing models with different numbers of classes.\r\nLCA’s output is intuitive and easy to interpret.\r\nWhat follows, is a a small demonstration of this tool on artificial employee survey data accompanying the book Predictive HR Analytics: Mastering the HR Metric by Edwards & Edwards (2019). It contains the survey responses of 832 employees on a 1 ‘strongly disagree’ to 5 ‘strongly agree’ response scale for a following set of statements.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(readxl)\r\nlibrary(DT)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n# uploading legend to the data\r\nlegend <- readxl::read_excel(\"./surveyResults.xls\", sheet = \"Legend\") \r\n\r\n# user-friendly table with individual survey items\r\nDT::datatable(\r\n  legend %>% dplyr::mutate(Scale = as.factor(Scale)),\r\n  class = 'cell-border stripe', \r\n  filter = 'top',\r\n  extensions = 'Buttons',\r\n  fillContainer = FALSE,\r\n  rownames= FALSE,\r\n  options = list(\r\n    pageLength = 5, \r\n    autoWidth = TRUE,\r\n    dom = 'Bfrtip',\r\n    buttons = c('copy'), \r\n    scrollX = TRUE, \r\n    selection=\"multiple\"\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore moving on to modeling, we first need to wrangle the data a bit - select the relevant variables, change their data type, and replace missing values with “Prefer Not to Say” reply category.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\ndata <- readxl::read_excel(\"./surveyResults.xls\", sheet = \"Data\")\r\n\r\n# preparing the data for modeling\r\nmydata <- data %>%\r\n  dplyr::select(-sex:-ethnicity) %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate_all(as.character) %>%\r\n  replace(is.na(.), \"Prefer Not to Say\") %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate_all(factor, levels = c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"Prefer Not to Say\"))\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can proceed with the modeling. For this we will use poLCA R package. One of the parameters to be set is the expected number of classes. To choose the right number, we need to fit several LCA models with different numbers of classes and, based on information criteria such as BIC or AIC, choose the model with the best balance between model complexity and good fit to the data. Here, I set the parameter to the best value I determined earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library\r\nlibrary(poLCA)\r\n\r\n# specifying and running the

    "contents": "\r\nIn a people analytics project I’m involved in, we were asked to come up with a prediction model that would perform reasonably well while being very easy to understand and interpret for non-technical users.\r\nIn considering various options, we also came across Bayesian networks (BNs), probabilistic graphical models consisting of nodes and directed edges that represent conditional (and under certain assumptions, causal) relationships between random variables. They seem to have several interesting properties that would suit our needs, namely:\r\nBN models are not “black boxes”, but all their parameters have a comprehensible interpretation, which may reduce users’ algorithm aversion and increase their willingness to take algorithm outputs into account in their decision-making.\r\nExpert knowledge can easily be used in the development of BN models by building the network structure using expert knowledge of im/plausible (causal) relationships between the variables under study.\r\nThe model lends itself to a user-friendly visualization of its structure, helping to design new models that take into account both data-based constraints and the knowledge of experts in the field.\r\nIt is possible to use the data itself to estimate the possible network topology and thus gain preliminary insight into the structure of the problem domain defined by the available variables.\r\nAfter fitting the model, it can be used for reasoning, i.e., calculating probabilities of interest conditional on the available evidence. This reasoning can be done even with incomplete data, based only on the known values of any combination of the available variables.\r\nThe attached graph is for illustrative purposes only - the output from early experiments with BNs on artificial IBM employee attrition data.\r\nHowever, when searching for information about this method, we found that it is not particularly popular among people analytics and I/O psychology practitioners. Would anyone of the readers happen to have a good or bad experience using this tool and would also be willing to share it? 🙏\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For this purpose, I used a sample dataset that accompanies the book Predictive HR Analytics: Mastering the HR Metric by Edwards & Edwards (2019).

To do this, we just need to get the necessary information from the network object and do a few data manipulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading \r\nlibrary(igraph)\r\nlibrary(ggraph)\r\n\r\n# extracting information about the connections form the network object\r\nngMatrix <- network$graph\r\n# inputting to upper part of the matrix zeroes (the edges between items are symmetrical, so we need just a half of the matrix)  \r\nngMatrix[upper.tri(ngMatrix)] <- 0\r\n\r\n# transforming matrix into dataframe\r\nngDf <- ngMatrix %>%\r\n  as.data.frame() %>%\r\n  tibble::rownames_to_column() %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(itemID = rowname)\r\n\r\n# creating a dataframe with information about connections between items\r\nfromToList <- data.frame()\r\n\r\nfor(i in unique(ngDf$itemID)){\r\n  \r\n  suppDf <- ngDf %>%\r\n    dplyr::filter(itemID == i) %>%\r\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(-itemID, names_to = \"to\", values_to = \"weight\") %>%\r\n    dplyr::filter(weight != 0) %>%\r\n    dplyr::rename(from = itemID) %>%\r\n    dplyr::mutate(\r\n      sign = case_when(\r\n        weight < 0 ~ \"negative\",\r\n        weight > 0 ~ \"positive\",\r\n        TRUE ~ \"zero\"\r\n      ),\r\n      weight = abs(weight)\r\n    )\r\n  \r\n  fromToList <- dplyr::bind_rows(fromToList, suppDf)\r\n  \r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n# creating a dataframe with information about individual items \r\nitems <- data.frame(\r\n  item = names(mydata),\r\n  scale = legend %>% pull(Scale)\r\n)\r\n\r\n# creating igraph object\r\nigraph_graph <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(fromToList, directed=FALSE, vertices = items)\r\n\r\n# visualizing the network\r\nset.seed(123)\r\nggraph::ggraph(igraph_graph, layout = \"fr\", maxiter = 500) +  # fr, kk, drl, mds, maxiter = 500 is default\r\n  ggraph::geom_edge_link(aes(edge_width = weight, color = sign), alpha = 0.05) + \r\n  ggraph::geom_node_point(aes(color = scale), size = 5) +\r\n  ggraph::geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 3) +\r\n  ggraph::theme_graph(background = \"white\") +\r\n  ggraph::scale_edge_color_manual(values = c(\"negative\" = \"red\", \"positive\" = \"blue\")) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Set1\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the charts we can quickly gain a basic idea of the internal structure of the data. For example, we can notice that:\r\nitems from the same scales tend to cluster close to each other;\r\nthere are items from different scales that appear to measure motivational aspects of employee attitudes (engagement, organizational citizenship behavior, and quitting intentions), and satisfaction with the “external forces” that affect employee experience (management, justice, and perceived organizational support);\r\nthe topic of autonomy is closely related to the topic of managerial motivation;\r\nmost of the negative partial correlations are between items measuring quitting intentions and other survey items.\r\nTo identify most influential topics (nodes) within the network, we can use centrality measures that quantify the relative importance of a node within a network based on different aspects of a node’s role in the network.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library\r\nlibrary(qgraph)\r\n\r\n# computing centrality measures for individual survey items\r\nqgraph::centralityPlot(network, include = \"all\", orderBy = \"ExpectedInfluence\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the expected influence centrality measure, which takes into account the presence of both negative and positive edges, the following items appear to be among the most influential ones:\r\nMan3: Management acts decisively.\r\nManMot3: My manager encourages me to do my best.\r\nJustice2: Procedures are applied fairly.\r\naut3: I am given enough leeway to get the job done.\r\nManMot1: My manager motivates me.\r\nBut to know how much we can rely on these measures, we must first test their stability using correlation stability analysis that repeatedly computes centrality indices of subsets of the data and correlates these with the centrality indices of the full data. This process generates a correlation stability coefficient (CS-Coefficient) for each centrality measure. The CS-Coefficient corresponds to the proportion of cases that can be dropped while retaining with 95% certainty a certain level of correlation (e.g., 0.7) between the original centrality measure and the centrality measure of the subset. The higher the CS-Coefficient, the more robust the centrality measure is to the reduction of cases. According to Epskamp & Fried (2018), the CS-coefficient should be above 0.5, and should be at least above 0.25. In our case, we can see the that we can make solid interpretations based on centrality measures of strength (CS(cor = 0.7) = 0.75) and expected influence (CS(cor = 0.7) = 0.75).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# estimating the stability of centrality measures\r\nbootnet_case_dropping <- bootnet::bootnet(\r\n  network, \r\n  nBoots = 2500,\r\n  type = \"case\",\r\n  nCores = 6,\r\n  statistics = c('strength', 'expectedInfluence', 'betweenness', 'closeness')\r\n)\r\n\r\n# plotting the results\r\nplot(bootnet_case_dropping, 'all')\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# listing the results\r\nbootnet::corStability(bootnet_case_dropping)\r\n\r\n=== Correlation Stability Analysis === \r\n\r\nSampling levels tested:\r\n   nPerson Drop%   n\r\n1      208  75.0 232\r\n2      273  67.2 242\r\n3      337  59.5 254\r\n4      402  51.7 246\r\n5      467  43.9 207\r\n6      532  36.1 259\r\n7      596  28.4 279\r\n8      661  20.6 267\r\n9      726  12.7 251\r\n10     790   5.0 263\r\n\r\nMaximum drop proportions to retain correlation of 0.7 in at least 95% of the samples:\r\n\r\nbetweenness: 0.05 (CS-coefficient is lowest level tested)\r\n  - For more accuracy, run bootnet(..., caseMin = 0, caseMax = 0.127) \r\n\r\ncloseness: 0.05 (CS-coefficient is lowest level tested)\r\n  - For more accuracy, run bootnet(..., caseMin = 0, caseMax = 0.127) \r\n\r\nexpectedInfluence: 0.75 (CS-coefficient is highest level tested)\r\n  - For more accuracy, run bootnet(..., caseMin = 0.672, caseMax = 1) \r\n\r\nstrength: 0.75 (CS-coefficient is highest level tested)\r\n  - For more accuracy, run bootnet(..., caseMin = 0.672, caseMax = 1) \r\n\r\nAccuracy can also be increased by increasing both 'nBoots' and 'caseN'.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, i.e. using a bootstrapping, we can estimate the stability of the edge weights. This gives us information on how much the edge weights for individual connections vary with 95% confidence intervals. From the chart below, it’s apparent that some edge weights are more accurate than others, as they show a narrower band. Simultaneously, we observe that the majority of edges closer to zero appear to be non-significant, as they intersect with zero in the bootstrapped samples.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# estimating the stability of edge weights \r\nbootnet_nonpar <- bootnet::bootnet(\r\n  network, \r\n  nBoots = 1000,\r\n  nCores = 6\r\n  )\r\n\r\n# plotting the results\r\nplot(bootnet_nonpar, labels = FALSE, order = \"sample\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find internal structure in the estimated network, we need not rely solely on the visual inspection of the network diagram, but we can use some of the common community detection algorithms that can be used to identify clusters of more densely connected topics. In the example below, we have merely ” replicated” an existing clustering by scale, which is an indication that the authors have managed to construct a survey that measures distinct constructs that they originally intended to measure, but in practice you are likely to observe less distinct patterns more often, which can give you clues about how to improve the construction of the employee survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# identifying communities/clusters\r\nclu <- igraph::cluster_louvain(igraph_graph, weights = fromToList$weight) # cluster_optimal, cluster_louvain, cluster_leading_eigen, cluster_fast_greedy, cluster_walktrap,   cluster_edge_betweenness, cluster_spinglass\r\n\r\n# assigning communities/clusters to nodes\r\nmember <- membership(clu)\r\nV(igraph_graph)$cluster <- as.character(member)\r\n\r\n# visualizing the network with identified communities/clusters\r\nset.seed(123)\r\nggraph::ggraph(igraph_graph, layout = \"fr\", maxiter = 500) +  # fr, kk, drl, mds, maxiter = 500 is default\r\n  ggraph::geom_edge_link(aes(edge_width = weight, color = sign), alpha = 0.05) + \r\n  ggraph::geom_node_point(aes(color = cluster), size = 5) +\r\n  ggraph::geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 3) +\r\n  ggraph::theme_graph(background = \"white\") +\r\n  ggraph::scale_edge_color_manual(values = c(\"negative\" = \"red\", \"positive\" = \"blue\")) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Set1\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother use case would be to test for differences in job attitudes’ connectivity and centrality across different groups of employees. To do this, we can use the NetworkComparisonTest R package that implements permutation based hypothesis testing of differences between two networks. Let’s illustrate it with differences between networks estimated on data coming from females and males. We first filter data for both genders and than estimate and visualize their respective attitudinal networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# filtering data for females and males \r\nmydataFemale <- data %>%\r\n  dplyr::filter(sex == 2) %>%\r\n  dplyr::select(ManMot1:pos3)\r\n\r\nmydataMale <- data %>%\r\n  dplyr::filter(sex == 1) %>%\r\n  dplyr::select(ManMot1:pos3)\r\n\r\n# estimating a regularized partial correlation network for females and males\r\nnetworkFemale <- bootnet::estimateNetwork(\r\n  mydataFemale,\r\n  default = \"EBICglasso\",\r\n  corMethod = \"spearman\",\r\n  threshold = FALSE \r\n)\r\n\r\nnetworkMale <- bootnet::estimateNetwork(\r\n  mydataMale,\r\n  default = \"EBICglasso\",\r\n  corMethod = \"spearman\",\r\n  threshold = FALSE \r\n)\r\n\r\n# plotting the estimated networks\r\nplot(\r\n  networkFemale, \r\n  layout = \"spring\",\r\n  groups = legend %>% dplyr::pull(Scale),\r\n  nodeNames = names(mydataFemale),\r\n  weighted = TRUE,\r\n  directed = FALSE,\r\n  label.cex = 0.7, \r\n  label.color = 'black', \r\n  label.prop = 0.9, \r\n  negDashed = TRUE, \r\n  legend.cex = 0.27, \r\n  legend.mode = 'style2',\r\n  font = 2,\r\n  theme = \"classic\",\r\n  title = \"Females\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nplot(\r\n  networkMale, \r\n  layout = \"spring\",\r\n  groups = legend %>% dplyr::pull(Scale),\r\n  nodeNames = names(mydataMale),\r\n  weighted = TRUE,\r\n  directed = FALSE,\r\n  label.cex = 0.7, \r\n  label.color = 'black', \r\n  label.prop = 0.9, \r\n  negDashed = TRUE, \r\n  legend.cex = 0.27, \r\n  legend.mode = 'style2',\r\n  font = 2,\r\n  theme = \"classic\",\r\n  title = \"Males\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can check four basic types of differences between the networks:\r\nThe maximum difference in edge weights (M statistic) that tells us whether the structure of the network is identical across two compared groups, and thus whether the groups differ in the overall “shape” or “architecture” of their attitudes.\r\nThe difference in global strength (S statistic) that tells us whether the density of the network is identical across the groups, and thus whether they differ in their openness to change of their attitudes and behaviors (see, for example, Zwicker et al. (2020)).\r\nThe difference in the centrality measures across the groups that tell us whether the groups differ in topics that are most important/influential in their attitudinal network.\r\nThe difference between groups in specific edges. According to van Borkulo et al. (2017), when the M statistic is not statistically significant, it is recommended not to test group-level differences for specific edges as it increases the likelihood of Type 1 error.\r\nAs you can see below, (almost) all test results are statistically non-significant, so we don’t have sufficiently strong evidence for claiming that there are substantive differences between females and males in their respective attitudinal networks. Only in the case of the Eng1 item (I share the values of this organization.), females show a statistically significantly smaller strength centrality measure compared to males. Given that M statistic is statistically non-significant, we don’t test statistical significance of differences for specific edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library\r\nlibrary(NetworkComparisonTest)\r\n\r\n# testing the differences\r\nset.seed(123)\r\ntestGenderDiff <- NetworkComparisonTest::NCT(\r\n  networkFemale, \r\n  networkMale, \r\n  binary.data=FALSE, \r\n  paired=FALSE,\r\n  weighted=TRUE,\r\n  test.edges=FALSE, \r\n  edges=\"all\",\r\n  p.adjust.methods=\"holm\",\r\n  test.centrality=TRUE, \r\n  centrality=c(\"strength\",\"expectedInfluence\"),\r\n  nodes=\"all\",\r\n  progressbar=FALSE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n# printing test results\r\nprint(testGenderDiff)\r\n\r\n\r\n NETWORK INVARIANCE TEST \r\n Test statistic M:  0.1747811 \r\n p-value 0.63 \r\n\r\n GLOBAL STRENGTH INVARIANCE TEST \r\n Global strength per group:  12.8295 13.39245 \r\n Test statistic S:  0.5629521 \r\n p-value 0.18 \r\n\r\n EDGE INVARIANCE TEST \r\n\r\nNULL\r\n\r\n CENTRALITY INVARIANCE TEST \r\n \r\n         strength expectedInfluence\r\nManMot1         1              1.00\r\nManMot2         1              1.00\r\nManMot3         1              1.00\r\nManMot4         1              1.00\r\nocb1            1              1.00\r\nocb2            1              1.00\r\nocb3            1              1.00\r\nocb4            1              1.00\r\naut1            1              1.00\r\naut2            1              1.00\r\naut3            1              1.00\r\nJustice1        1              1.00\r\nJustice2        1              1.00\r\nJustice3        1              1.00\r\nJobSat1         1              1.00\r\nJobSat2         1              1.00\r\nQuit1           1              1.00\r\nQuit2           1              1.00\r\nQuit3           1              1.00\r\nMan1            1              1.00\r\nMan2            1              1.00\r\nMan3            1              1.00\r\nEng1            0              0.57\r\nEng2            1              1.00\r\nEng3            1              1.00\r\nEng4            1              1.00\r\npos1            1              1.00\r\npos2            1              1.00\r\npos3            1              1.00\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# checking observed differences in centrality measures\r\n# testGenderDiff$diffcen.real \r\n\r\n# plotting results of the network structure invariance test\r\n# plot(testGenderDiff,what=\"network\")\r\n# plotting results of global strength invariance test\r\n# plot(testGenderDiff,what=\"strength\")\r\n# plotting results of the edge invariance test\r\n# plot(testGenderDiff,what=\"edge\")\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you find this post useful and that it inspires you to try PNA on your own data.

    "contents": "\r\nA vendor specializing in employee engagement measurements recently presented their findings that companies with the highest and lowest levels of commitment prior to a layoff compared to the benchmark, experienced the largest decreases and largest increases in commitment post-layoff, respectively. They post-hoc-hypothesized that highly committed employees feel especially hurt and betrayed when layoffs occur.\r\nHowever, when a similar pattern emerges, a warning light should always flash that regression to the mean (RTM) might actually be behind it. When a variable is imperfectly correlated with another variable, extreme values tend to gravitate towards the mean in subsequent measurements, which can make natural variations in repeated data appear like genuine change.\r\nThis doesn’t mean that RTM was the sole factor in the aforementioned case. However, to know better, it’s necessary to control for it.\r\nWhat follows is a simple simulation to illustrate how the reported finding could occur purely or partially due to RTM, and how one might control for it.\r\nFirst, let’s create correlated employee commitment observations per company from time 1 (T1) and time 2 (T2).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading necessary libraries\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\nset.seed(1) # seed for reproducibility\r\nn <- 2000 # number of observations\r\nT1 <- rnorm(n) # generating observations at time 1\r\nT2 <- 0.7*T1 + rnorm(n)*sqrt(1-0.7^2) # generating correlated observations at time 2\r\n\r\n# cor(T1, T2) # checking the correlation\r\n\r\ndf <- data.frame(T1=T1, T2=T2) # putting created variables into dataframe\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also need a benchmark for T1 so that we can calculate the difference between T1 values and T1 benchmark. In addition, we also need to calculate the difference between T2 and T1.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# computing benchmark for pre-layoff period (T1)\r\nbenchmark <- df %>%\r\n  dplyr::summarise(\r\n    benchmark = mean(T1)\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::pull(benchmark)\r\n\r\n# computing differences between T2 and T1 and between T1 and T1 benchmark (average)\r\ndf <- df %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    timeDiff = T2-T1,\r\n    benchmarkDiff = T1-benchmark\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nThen all we have to do is randomly assign individual observations to the group of companies that made layoffs and those that did not.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# assigning each observation randomly one of two labels - Layoffs/NoLayoffs \r\ndf1 <- df %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    Layoffs = sample(c(\"Layoffs\", \"NoLayoffs\"), size = n(), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.15, 0.85))\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can contrast the differences between T1 values and T1 benchmark on the one hand and the differences between T2 and T1 on the other. As we can see in the chart below, the pattern matches well with the originally reported finding\r\n- companies with the highest and lowest levels of commitment prior to a layoff compared to the benchmark, experienced the largest decreases and largest increases in commitment post-layoff, respectively, but now purely as a result of RTM.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# visualizing relationship between the \r\ndf1 %>%\r\n  dplyr::filter(Layoffs == \"Layoffs\") %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = benchmarkDiff, y = timeDiff)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-2,4,1)) +\r\n  labs(\r\n    x = \"DIFFERENCE BETWEEN T1 AND T1 BENCHMARK\",\r\n    y = \"DIFFERENCE BETWEEN T2 AND T1\",\r\n    title = \"Changes in employee commitment purely due to regression to the mean\",\r\n    caption = \"\\nA replication of the original finding that companies with the highest and lowest levels of commitment prior to a layoff compared to the benchmark, experienced\\nthe largest decreases and largest increases in commitment post-layoff, respectively, relying only on a regression to the mean phenomenon.\\nT1 and T2 refer to commitment measurements at time 1 (prior to a layoff) and time 2 (after a layoff), respectively.\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    plot.title = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"bold\", size = 18, margin=margin(0,0,20,0)),\r\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 15, margin=margin(0,0,20,0)),\r\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 11, hjust = 0),\r\n    axis.title.x.bottom = element_text(margin = margin(t = 15, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0), color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 13, lineheight = 16, hjust = 0),\r\n    axis.title.y.left = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 15, b = 0, l = 0), color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 13, lineheight = 16, hjust = 1),\r\n    axis.text = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 12, lineheight = 16),\r\n    axis.line = element_line(colour = \"#E0E1E6\"),\r\n    axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"#E0E1E6\"),\r\n    strip.text.x = element_text(size = 11, face = \"plain\"),\r\n    legend.position= \"bottom\",\r\n    legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\r\n    legend.key.width = unit(1.6, \"line\"),\r\n    legend.margin = margin(0,0,0,0, unit=\"cm\"),\r\n    legend.text = element_text(color = '#2C2F46', face = \"plain\", size = 10, lineheight = 16),\r\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\r\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\r\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\r\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\r\n    plot.margin=unit(c(5,5,5,5),\"mm\"), \r\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\r\n    plot.caption.position =  \"plot\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, in order to make a valid estimate of the effect of layoffs on employee commitment when RTM is at play, we need to control for its effect.

It was also a good opportunity to try out Shiny for Python by Posit.

    "contents": "\r\nSome time ago, I “replicated” Rynes, Colbert, and Brown’s 2002 study on HR practitioners’ beliefs about effective HR practices on a convenience sample of more than 140 LinkedIn users. The results of this “replication” closely resembled the results of the original study. On average, respondents correctly answered 19.4 out of 35 items, achieving a 55% success rate, which was very close to the 57% average success rate in the original study (and also quite close to the 50% success rate that corresponds to random choice, given the TRUE/FALSE response format).\r\nI was curious to see how GPT-4 would perform in this test, as it had been evaluated on various standardized tests such as the SAT, GRE, Bar Exam, and AP. The prompts used had the following form: Read the following statement and indicate whether it is true or false. Keep in mind that the statement refers to general trends and patterns that apply on average but not necessarily to all cases. When evaluating the statement, ensure that you correctly interpret the words used in the statement and take into account existing scientific evidence. Give me the answer either true or false, without intermediate values, in a boolean way. Finally, briefly explain your reasoning behind your answer. The statement is as follows:…\r\nSo, what were the results? GPT-4 answered 29 out of 35 items right, i.e., it achieved an 83% success rate, which corresponds to the 99th and 97th percentiles in the original and “replicated” studies, respectively. GPT-4’s results were thus superior to majority of people who took the test.\r\n\r\nHowever, even when it gave a correct answer, it did not always rely on correct facts and/or valid reasoning, which could be a problem if management decided to act on the answers provided. See the table below to check the details of its responses.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(readxl)\r\nlibrary(DT)\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\nmydata <- readxl::read_xlsx(\"./gpt4Responses.xlsx\")\r\n\r\n# creating user-friendly table\r\nDT::datatable(\r\n  mydata %>% \r\n    dplyr::select(itemId, item, gpt4Response, correctAnswer, gpt4Reasoning, researchEvidence, possibleContingencies) %>%\r\n    dplyr::rename(\"Item ID\"=itemId, Item=item, \"GPT-4 response\"=gpt4Response, \"Correct answer\"=correctAnswer, \"GPT-4 reasoning\"=gpt4Reasoning, \"Research evidence\"=researchEvidence, \"Possible contingencies\"=possibleContingencies),\r\n  class = 'cell-border stripe', \r\n  filter = 'top',\r\n  extensions = 'Buttons',\r\n  fillContainer = FALSE,\r\n  rownames= FALSE,\r\n  options = list(\r\n    pageLength = 3,\r\n    autoWidth = TRUE,\r\n    columnDefs = list(list(width = '500px', targets = c(\"Item\", \"GPT-4 reasoning\", \"Research evidence\", \"Possible contingencies\"))),\r\n    dom = 'Bfrtip',\r\n    buttons = c('copy'), \r\n    scrollX = TRUE, \r\n    selection=\"multiple\"\r\n  )\r\n) %>%\r\n  DT::formatStyle(1:7, 'vertical-align'='top')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possible takeaway from this finding? Although GPT-4 can be a handy tool for exploring possible solutions to specific HR-related problems, on its own and in its current form it cannot replace the good old systematic search for and retrieval of evidence, critical evaluation of its reliability and relevance, and its weighing and synthesis as conducted and/or supervised by human experts.\r\nP.S. I didn’t test the reliability of GPT-4’s responses, nor did I set its temperature to 0, so it’s possible that you might obtain somewhat different results if you decide to replicate the test. In addition, please keep in mind that the comparison presented here is not entirely an apples-to-apples comparison, mainly due to the fact that new evidence may have emerged that does not match the correct answers in the original study conducted more than 20 years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nA while ago, I posted about the potential of using GPT for processing open-ended feedback from employees. I simply inputted a block of text into GPT and asked for a summary of the major topics found in the feedback. Although the output was quite accurate and the information compression achieved was very useful, this approach was somewhat limited in terms of scalability and granularity of the information provided.\r\nTo address these limitations, I experimented with another approach that includes the following steps:\r\nLooping over feedback from individual employees and sending them one by one to GPT.\r\nPrompting GPT to identify all present topics in each feedback, determining their respective sentiments (positive, negative, mixed, or neutral), and extracting the relevant parts of the feedback based on which the topic was identified.\r\nPrompting GPT to categorize identified topics using a provided list of topic categories (e.g., compensation and benefits, work-life balance, collaboration and teamwork, etc.), while taking into account contextual information in the relevant parts of the feedback. Alternatively, categorizing by matching embeddings of identified topics, contextual information, and topic categories.\r\nPlotting the topic categories by the number of their occurrences and type of associated sentiment.\r\nInteractive exploration of specific topics clustered by their semantic similarity based on their respective embeddings and visualized with the help of t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique.\r\nCreating a filterable table with identified topics and all original and extracted information that may be useful for further exploration of the feedback and for checking the precision of the topic identification.\r\nI had to experiment a bit with the prompts and include some data-munging inter-steps to get useful outputs, however, it now works relatively smoothly and provides pretty good results. To test the plausibility of this approach, I tried it on publicly available feedback from more than 300 current and former employees of an unnamed company published on Glassdoor and shared on Kaggle. You can check the results of the analysis yourself in this simple dashboard.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it works quite well and could represent a very time- and cost-effective way to gain useful insights from employee open-ended feedback at scale, with the caveat that one has to ensure the security of the processed data, for example, by using a local LLM. Let me know what you think about this approach. And if you are interested in the Python code behind the analysis so you can play with it on your own data, here’s the link to the GitHub page with the Python code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Some of the most significant biases include survivorship bias, social desirability, non-response bias, self-selection, and motivated reasoning.\r\nDr. Paul De Young’s personal experience in this regard is quite telling: “There is often a high preponderance of phony ratings among so-called current employees on Glassdoor. Beware of bogus “part time” current employees giving high ratings, especially if the company does not employ a lot of part-time employees.Also, I learned from an HR executive that if you want to get ratings up on Glassdoor, encourage ALL your employees to rate the company. Most often it is the mistreated employees who post because this is an outlet for their misfortune. By getting more employees to rate, chances are your ratings will increase. Watch for actively monitored employers on Glassdoor. You can usually tell a bogus rating because there is a high rating with very few comments in jobs that do not exist. The first thing I do when looking at a company is to filter out the part time employees and look at the impact on the overall scores. If they jump down, you have to wonder about the validity of the ratings. Read the comments, they are more telling. There are all kinds of ways to game the system. Glassdoor is helpful, but doesn’t always give you a valid picture without looking at the details, which is where the devil lives.”\r\nHowever, it doesn’t mean that there is no signal in Glassdoor ratings. For example, behavioral scientists at Culture Amp investigated the relationship between Glassdoor ratings and employee engagement data collected by Culture Amp. The findings suggested a strong correlation between employee engagement and Glassdoor ratings, particularly as the number of reviews increases (r = 0.69 for 100+ reviews). Companies with higher engagement scores tended to have better Glassdoor ratings, including higher CEO approval percentages and a greater likelihood of being recommended as a workplace. The study also identified the five factors with the largest relationship to Glassdoor scores, which included Learning and Development, Service and Quality Focus, Decision-making, Leadership, and Collaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

What are the main insights?\r\nIt may not come as a big surprise, but it is encouraging that data support the association between time management and various beneficial employee outcomes, such as increased job satisfaction, job performance, and lower levels of stress and burnout. Unfortunately, the “proven” association is not causal, as the majority of studies were cross-sectional. In fact, there are not many studies on the causal effects of time management. The exception to this is procrastination, for which there is evidence that time management can help - see, for example, the meta-analysis by Van Eerde & Klingsieck (2018) on this topic.\r\nThe relationship between time management and employee outcomes is not only direct but also partially mediated by work-family conflict. This finding underscores the importance of work-life balance and highlights the need for organizations to help employees better address this specific issue, as it may positively affect a variety of employee outcomes.\r\n\r\nPerceived control over time, achieved through the use of time management, shows incremental validity in predicting job satisfaction, job performance, and stress with respect to the personality trait of conscientiousness. This suggests that regardless of an individual’s innate level of prudence, they may benefit from adopting time management in their professional lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nThere’s a great new R package, modelStudio, that makes it much easier for analysts to create both global and local interpretations of predictive models using an interactive interface.\r\nOnce you’ve trained the model, you just get the DALEX explainer object ready and start up modelStudio that will run the following analyses (among others) and show the corresponding plots:\r\nFeature Importance: A visual representation that ranks and displays the significance of each input variable in a predictive model, helping to identify the most influential features for model predictions.\r\nPartial Dependence: A visualization that shows the relationship between a feature and the predicted outcome while averaging out the effects of all other features, to understand the marginal impact of a specific feature on the model’s predictions.\r\nAccumulated Dependence: Similar to the previous method, but reducing the influence of the assumption of uncorrelated features, providing a more robust and reliable representation of the feature’s impact on the model’s predictions.\r\nBreak Down Plot: A graphical explanation tool that demonstrates the contribution of each feature to a specific instance’s prediction, allowing for individual-level interpretation of model outcomes.\r\nShapley Values: A cooperative game theory-based approach for fairly attributing each feature’s contribution to a specific prediction, providing interpretable and consistent explanations for machine learning models.\r\nCeteris Paribus: A method that helps with understanding the influence of individual features on specific predictions by isolating the effect of a single variable while holding all other variables constant.\r\nIf you use ML in HR or any other field where it’s crucial to explain why you make specific predictions, classifications, and the resulting recommendations or decisions, definitely give it a try.\r\nWhat follows is a short demonstration of the tool using the well-known artificial IBM attrition dataset. First, let’s import the attrition dataset from the modeldata library and change the coding of the criterion variable, which will later make it easier to set up the DALEX explainer, which requires numerical data type for criterion variable even in classification tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(modeldata)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\ndata(\"attrition\")\r\n\r\n# changing the coding of the criterion variable\r\nattrition <- attrition %>%\r\n  mutate(Attrition = recode(Attrition, \"Yes\" = \"1\", \"No\" = \"0\") %>% factor(levels = c(\"1\", \"0\")))\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now split the data into training, test, and validation datasets so that we can tune the prediction model, fit the model, and test its performance on new, previously unseen data.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(rsample)\r\n\r\n# splitting data into train, validation, and test datasets\r\nset.seed(123)\r\ndata_split <- rsample::initial_split(attrition, strata = Attrition, prop = 0.8)\r\n\r\ndata_train <- rsample::training(data_split)\r\ndata_test  <- rsample::testing(data_split)\r\ndata_val <- rsample::validation_split(data_train, strata = \"Attrition\", prop = 0.8)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let’s define the whole model training workflow, which includes the data adjustment pipeline and the specification of the model used. We will use XGBoost, presumably the best ML algorithm for tabular type of data.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(recipes)\r\nlibrary(parsnip)\r\nlibrary(workflows)\r\n\r\nfmla <- as.formula(paste(\"Attrition\", \" ~ .\"))\r\n\r\n# defining recipe for adjusting data for fitting the model\r\nxgb_recipe <- \r\n  recipes::recipe(fmla, data = data_train) %>%\r\n  recipes::step_ordinalscore(recipes::all_ordered_predictors()) %>%\r\n  recipes::step_dummy(recipes::all_factor_predictors())\r\n\r\n# defining the model\r\nxgb_model <- \r\n  parsnip::boost_tree(mtry = tune(), min_n = tune(), tree_depth = tune(), trees = 1000) %>% \r\n  parsnip::set_engine(\"xgboost\") %>% \r\n  parsnip::set_mode(\"classification\")\r\n\r\nxgb_workflow <- \r\n  workflows::workflow() %>% \r\n  workflows::add_model(xgb_model) %>% \r\n  workflows::add_recipe(xgb_recipe)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the XGBoost algorithm works quite well with the default hyper-parameters, we will use the validation dataset to tune some of its hyper-parameters to get the best performance out of it. As can be seen below, after tuning the best model performs quite well in terms of AUC, which has a value of around 0.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(tune)\r\nlibrary(yardstick)\r\n\r\n# tuning hyper-parameters\r\nset.seed(123)\r\nxgb_tuning <- \r\n  xgb_workflow %>% \r\n  tune::tune_grid(\r\n    data_val,\r\n    grid = 25,\r\n    control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE),\r\n    metrics = yardstick::metric_set(roc_auc)\r\n    )\r\n\r\n# selecting the best combination of hyper-parameters \r\nxgb_best <- \r\n  xgb_tuning %>% \r\n  tune::select_best(metric = \"roc_auc\")\r\n\r\n# best model performance on validation dataset as measured by AUC \r\n(\r\n  xgb_tuning %>% \r\n  tune::collect_predictions(parameters = xgb_best) %>% \r\n  yardstick::roc_auc(truth = Attrition,  .pred_1) \r\n)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\r\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\r\n  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\r\n1 roc_auc binary         0.802\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# plotting the ROC curve\r\nxgb_tuning %>% \r\n  tune::collect_predictions(parameters = xgb_best) %>% \r\n  yardstick::roc_curve(truth = Attrition,  .pred_1) %>%\r\n  autoplot()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can set up the final model training workflow and fit the model to the entire training dataset and check its performance on out-of-sample data using k-fold cross-validation and testing dataset. As we see below, in both cases the model performance as measured by AUC is around the value of 0.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# setting the final model\r\nfinal_xgb_model <- \r\n  parsnip::boost_tree(mtry = xgb_best$mtry, min_n = xgb_best$min_n, tree_depth = xgb_best$tree_depth, trees = 1000) %>% \r\n  parsnip::set_engine(\"xgboost\") %>% \r\n  parsnip::set_mode(\"classification\")\r\n\r\n# updating the model training workflow\r\nfinal_xgb_workflow <- \r\n  xgb_workflow %>% \r\n  workflows::update_model(final_xgb_model)\r\n\r\n# fitting model on train set\r\nset.seed(123)\r\nxgb_fit <- \r\n  final_xgb_workflow %>% \r\n  fit(data_train)\r\n\r\n# checking the final model's performance (AUC) using k-fold cross-validation\r\nset.seed(123)\r\nfolds <- rsample::vfold_cv(data_train, v = 10)\r\n\r\nset.seed(123)\r\nxgb_fit_kf <- \r\n  final_xgb_workflow %>% \r\n  tune::fit_resamples(folds)\r\n\r\n(\r\n  tune::collect_metrics(xgb_fit_kf, summarize = TRUE) %>% dplyr::filter(.metric == \"roc_auc\")\r\n)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\r\n  .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err .config             \r\n  <chr>   <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl> <chr>               \r\n1 roc_auc binary     0.799    10  0.0166 Preprocessor1_Model1\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# checking the final model's performance (AUC) using the testing dataset\r\nxgb_testing_pred <- \r\n  predict(xgb_fit, data_test) %>% \r\n  bind_cols(predict(xgb_fit, data_test, type = \"prob\")) %>% \r\n  dplyr::bind_cols(data_test %>% select(Attrition))\r\n\r\n(\r\n  xgb_testing_pred %>%           \r\n  yardstick::roc_auc(truth = Attrition, .pred_1)\r\n)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\r\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\r\n  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\r\n1 roc_auc binary         0.871\r\n\r\nNow we’re ready to explore the inner workings of our trained model. After setting up the explainer from the DALEX package, we simply insert this object into the modelStudio function and run it. We then get an interactive interface in our browser that we can use to easily check what our model is doing to make its predictions. You can try it out for yourself using the interactive interface below.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(DALEX)\r\nlibrary(modelStudio)\r\n\r\n# setting up the DALEX explainer object\r\n# creating predict function\r\npred <- function(model, newdata)  {\r\n  results <- (predict(model, newdata, type = \"prob\")[[1]])\r\n  return(results)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexplainer <- DALEX::explain(\r\n  model = xgb_fit,\r\n  data = data_test %>% mutate(Attrition = as.integer(Attrition)),\r\n  y = data_test %>% mutate(Attrition = as.integer(Attrition)) %>% pull(Attrition),\r\n  predict_function = pred,\r\n  type = \"classification\",\r\n  verbose = FALSE \r\n)\r\n\r\n# running ModelStudio\r\nmodelStudio::modelStudio(\r\n  explainer,\r\n  max_features = 100, # Maximum number of features to be included in BD, SV, and FI plots\r\n  N = 300, # Number of observations used for the calculation of PD and AD\r\n  new_observation_n = 3, #Number of observations to be taken from the data\r\n  show_info = TRUE,\r\n  viewer = \"browser\",\r\n  facet_dim = c(2,2) # layout of the resultiing charts\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As a joke, I asked him if he had already tried using GPT for this.\r\nThis sparked my interest in how GPT would actually handle this kind of task. So, I provided it with my Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI) profile (in percentile scores, as requested), and to my surprise, it performed quite well - even when asked about more complex questions like interactions between my scores on selected scales or my strengths and weaknesses for specific jobs and tasks.\r\nBased on this experience, I created a simple POC app where users can input their HPI profile and some contextual information, such as their current or desired job, and ask GPT predefined or their own questions about their personality.\r\nLink to the app: https://aanalytics.shinyapps.io/ask_your_personality/\r\n\r\nI’ve only tested it on a few profiles, so if you know your HPI profile (or your Big Five traits that are behind HPI), I would be happy to hear how you perceive the face validity and potential usefulness of the generated interpretations. Perhaps I have just become a victim of the well-known Barnum effect 😉\r\nI am well aware that there are clear risks associated with using a generic GPT for such a task. However, I believe that with proper fine-tuning, an explicit disclaimer, and access to a qualified professional for possible consultation, it could be a useful tool for helping people gain self-awareness more easily - in many situations a crucial prerequisite for high-quality decisions.

Consequently, we might be naturally interested in whether we can positively influence engagement of employees through the use of certain interventions.\r\nBased on a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies with controlled workplace interventions by Knight, Patterson, and Dawson (2017), it seems the answer might be yes. The authors found a small positive effect on work engagement and each of its three sub-components: vigor, dedication, and absorption, as measured by the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) from Bakker and Schaufeli.\r\nWhen it comes to the types of intervention (personal resource building, job resource building, leadership training, and health promotion), a moderator analysis did not find evidence for their differing effectiveness. However, there was evidence for a medium to strong effect of intervention style in favor of group interventions (vs. individual), with the possible explanation being that group interventions effectively influence certain work engagement antecedents, such as social support and influence in decision-making.\r\n\r\nRegarding the sustainability of effects, there was no significant effect of time in the case of overall work engagement. However, for the vigor sub-component, there were stronger effects immediately post-intervention than at follow-up, with the opposite being true for dedication and absorption sub-components.\r\nHave you implemented any interventions to boost engagement of employees in your organization? Did you measure their effectiveness? What were your experiences and results? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Unsurprisingly, even managers and leaders fall for this trap. After all, they’re human too, right? 😉 For a review of studies on this topic, see, for example, the systematic review by Heavey et al. (2022).\r\nTo pinpoint particular areas where managers and leaders are prone to overconfidence, data from the Team Assessment Survey (TAS), a team assessment tool rooted in the Rocket Model of team performance, can be valuable as it enables comparisons between how team leaders and team members perceive their team’s functioning. For example, based on data from a Slovak sample of 85 teams with 835 members, it seems that team leaders rate their team’s effectiveness way better than team members in the following five areas in descending order:\r\nResources: Does the team have the budget, equipment, authority, and political capital it needs to accomplish its goals?\r\nTalent: Is the team sized correctly? Are team members’ roles clear? Does the team have the right skills to succeed? Are people developing new skills? Do rewards encourage or discourage teamwork?\r\nContext: Are team members in agreement about the team’s political and economic realities, customers, competitors, suppliers, and key assumptions and challenges?\r\nMission: What is the team’s purpose? What are its goals? How does the team define winning? What are its strategies and plans for accomplishing its goals?\r\nCourage: Do team members trust each other? Is there an optimal level of tension and collaboration on this team? Do team members challenge each other in a constructive manner?\r\n\r\nWhen managers get overconfident in these areas, it can lead to all sorts of issues like underinvestment in critical resources, inefficient resource allocation, ignoring skill gaps, insufficient role clarity, making bad decisions, disjointed strategic planning, confusion, misaligned priorities, uncoordinated efforts, blocking innovation, etc.\r\nWhat’s the fix? Among other things, managers need to be aware of their own biases and work on open communication, feedback, and collaboration with team members. Easier said than done, but it’s crucial to avoid hurting the performance of the team.\r\nObviously, the size and demographics of the sample used are limited and conclusions are therefore difficult to generalize, but I may try to check with Dr. Gordon Curphy, the author of the Rocket Model of team performance and TAS, to see if this pattern is also replicated in a larger, international sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nWhen considering the introduction of a new business app, one of the benefits of piloting it is that it provides a great opportunity to test its causal impact on business processes or outcomes of interest. For example, in our pilots, apps are typically implemented for 3 or 6 months only in some teams and not in others. Such a situation creates ideal conditions for applying the difference-in-differences (DiD) method, which is used to approximate an experimental research design with observational data only.\r\nTo use one specific example, one of the problems addressed by our Sales Analytics app is that sales reps spend more time collaborating internally instead of communicating with prospects. The premise may be that the better visibility into time spent that the app enables will help sales reps and their managers better plan activities during their regular weekly 1-on-1 meetings, all with (hopefully) a positive impact on time spent with prospects.\r\nBy piloting the app in just one team and finding another team with a similar, parallel trend in the selected criterion, we can try to estimate its effectiveness. As shown in the attached chart, the fitted DiD model in this particular case slightly supports the effectiveness of the app, at least in terms of the amount of time spent with prospects, but can easily be switched to another criterion that is closer to the company’s bottom line, e.g., the number of closed deals. Moreover, if we are aware of certain systematic differences between the teams, such as the experience level of the sales reps, we can include relevant control variables in the model to achieve a more accurate estimation of the app’s effectiveness.\r\n\r\nSo, next time you consider introducing a new business app, consider piloting it in combination with the DiD method to better understand its impact on your organization’s goals. Happy piloting! ✌️\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As any statistically savvy person knows, not necessarily.\r\nFortunately, there are research designs that can help us untangle this conundrum a bit. One of these designs is path analysis of longitudinal/time-series data. This approach was also taken by Harter et al. (2010) in their meta-analysis “Causal Impact of Employee Work Perceptions on the Bottom Line of Organizations” with the following results:\r\n“Using a massive longitudinal database that included 2,178 business units in 10 large organizations, we found evidence supporting the causal impact of employee perceptions on […] bottom-line measures [customer loyalty, employee retention, revenue, and profit]; reverse causality of bottom-line measures on employee perceptions existed but was weaker.”\r\nThe attached figure with the two alternative path models clearly shows that the causal path from employee perceptions to outcomes is stronger than the other way around, especially when it comes to theoretically more proximal outcomes such as employee retention and customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nDespite not being free of potential biases, these results add more weight to the argument that investing in improving employee job satisfaction also makes sense for improving a company’s bottom line, rather than “only” improving employee well-being. The question now is what interventions to improve employee satisfaction might work. Let’s review the available evidence on this issue in one of the next posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It’s not as exciting and sexy as ChatGPT, but it may still come in handy for someone, as it did for one of my friends.\r\nA friend of mine who works in psychological counselling has to write a large number of reports which, among other things, contain many recommendations for various compensations and interventions depending on established diagnosis.\r\nTo make his job easier, he created a simple Excel spreadsheet with a list of diagnoses and corresponding recommendations. He needed to generate a simple Word document listing and describing the appropriate compensations and interventions after he had marked the appropriate diagnoses for the client in Excel.\r\nI originally wanted to do it all in Excel, but since I’m not the best friend with VBA, I couldn’t get rid of the various text formatting issues. So I reached for Python and one of its document-related libraries and linked it via macro to Excel, which acts only as a source of input data, based on which Python generates a simple report when a button is pressed in Excel. Once generated, the document is ready for further editing and tuning.\r\nIf you are interested in technical details, you can check my GitHub page.\r\nMay the Excel be with you 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As shown in the table attached,\r\nperformance is most strongly predicted by job satisfaction, job engagement, and distributive justice (an employee’s perceived fairness of outcomes),\r\nturnover intentions is most strongly predicted by job satisfaction, perceived organizational support (a general evaluation regarding the extent to which employees feel their organization values their contribution and cares about their well-being), and distributive justice, and\r\norganizational citizenship behaviors is most strongly predicted by job engagement, procedural justice (perceived fairness of the means, or procedures, used to determine outcomes), and job involvement (the degree to which a person identifies psychologically with his or her work, or the importance of work in his or her total self-image).\r\n\r\nIMO, knowing this can be quite useful in planning what candidate constructs to measure in your company in an effort to support specific employee outcomes.\r\nWhat job attitudes do you regularly measure in your company?

It seems that the effects are univocal and generalizable for the well-being outcomes. These were relatively homogeneous, and none of the included moderators were significant. Hence, the data suggest that micro-breaks may be a panacea for fostering well-being during worktime.\r\nWhen it comes to performance, the data revealed some nuances. The break duration was a significant covariate of the effect of micro-breaks: the longer the break, the better the performance. Moreover, the type of task from which participants were taking the break also emerged as a significant moderator. Micro-breaks could significantly increase performance for clerical work or creative exercises and not for a cognitively demanding task.”\r\nThere is nothing like having a meta-analysis to back up your habits, or better yet, initially bad habits 😉\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Such a pattern is probably a good thing in many cases as it means that people have more time for focused work when working remotely, and use their time for intensive collaboration when in the office.\r\nWhat was quite surprising to me, however, was the rather large difference in the amount of distracted time. When working in the office there was much more distracted time, i.e. time when people were working on their tasks while being distracted by various collaborative activities. Therefore, they didn’t have enough time to get into the flow. On average, the difference was a staggering ~69 minutes per person per day.\r\nHowever, when I thought about it a bit more (and also after I realized how we actually calculate distraction time️), it started to make more sense to me. After all, collaborative activities don’t just “rob” us of time per se, they also fragment our available time into smaller chunks, which carries a cost in the form of cognitive overhead associated with task switching.\r\nI suppose it’s a trade-off that can’t be completely solved in principle, but can only be mitigated with tools like batching or timeboxing. What is your own experience with this phenomenon and what tools do you use to deal with it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These meetings often serve only to disseminate information and can therefore be safely replaced by less intrusive asynchronous collaboration tools such as email, instant messaging or some kind of knowledge management tool.\r\nRecurring meetings have their place, but often tend to outlive their purpose over time and waste the time of everyone involved. One should therefore regularly ask oneself the following questions in this context and act accordingly: Are meetings being planned automatically, rather than out of necessity? Are attendees invited as a formality, or will they bring value? Is there still clear agenda for these meetings? Are we already sufficiently aligned or do we need some additional platform for doing so? Does the current frequency of our meetings meet our needs? etc.\r\nAs illustrated in the attached chart, large and recurring meetings can represent a relatively large chunk of time in an employee’s work month. Large meetings here account for approximately 37% of all meeting time and more than 80% of large meetings are recurring. This represents a relatively large room for optimizing the time spent in meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There are more\r\nversions of this tool, e.g. one from Jaap\r\nPaauwe and Ray Richardson or another one from Max\r\nBlumberg, but what they have in common is a kind of causal flow from\r\nHRM activities to HRM outcomes to business outcomes.\r\nExample of the HRM value chain\r\nmodel from Paauwe\r\n& Richardson (1997).\r\n\r\nExample of the HRM value chain\r\nmodel from Blumberg\r\n(2018).\r\nHowever, as potentially useful as this metaphor of the organization\r\nas a kind of “machine” with certain inputs, processes, and outputs is,\r\nit is still only a conceptual tool that may or may not correspond to the\r\nreality of a particular organization.\r\nIn this regard, it may help if we try to operationalize this\r\nmetaphor. In this effort, structural\r\nequation modeling can be very handy, as it allows us to\r\nformalize our ideas about the relationships between several different\r\nvariables and to assess the extent to which these ideas are consistent\r\nwith the available data. After all, no one wants to make decisions based\r\non false assumptions.\r\nTo illustrate this with a more tangible example, let’s use sabermetric data\r\nfrom the famous Moneyball\r\ncase and let’s try to formally model the Oakland A’s\r\n(OAK) as a “machine” that produces playoffs by trying to win more games\r\nor score more points than opposing teams, using inputs in the form of\r\nplayers’ ability to play well at bat and in the field.\r\nBased on our expert knowledge of the game of baseball, our working\r\nhypotheses, and the results of some previous analyses, we can construct\r\na conceptual model of how a baseball team functions, as outlined\r\nbelow.\r\nConceptual model of how a\r\nbaseball team works.\r\nThe diagram shows clearly how this “machine” works: Its outputs are\r\nqualifications for the playoffs, which it achieves by trying to win more\r\ngames or score more points than the opposing teams; to do this, it uses\r\ninputs in the form of the players’ ability to play well at bat and in\r\nthe field; the inputs affecting the “machine’s” operation are also the\r\nsimilar abilities of the opposing teams’ players. This is, of course, a\r\nvery simplistic causal model of how the OAK team operates, but as the\r\nfamous statistical aphorism states, all models are\r\nwrong, but some are useful.\r\nHowever incomplete our models of how an organization works will\r\nalways be, it is essential to check that these models sufficiently\r\nreflect reality as conveyed by the available data. Only after such an\r\nassessment of the plausibility of the model it is reasonable to base\r\nfurther, e.g. hiring or L&D decisions on it. And, as hinted at the\r\nbeginning of this post, we will use the statistical method of structural\r\nequation modeling to do this. So let’s apply this method to our model of\r\nthe OAK and test its plausibility.\r\nWe will use data from a publicly available database\r\nof MLB historical statistics. Specifically, we will use the\r\nfollowing variables:\r\nqualification for the playoffs in a given season\r\n(Playoffs),\r\nnumber of wins in a given season (W),\r\nnumber of points won in a given season (RS),\r\nnumber of points lost in a given season (RA),\r\naverage frequency with which a player reaches base per plate\r\nappearance in a given season (OBP - On-Base Percentage) and\r\nanalogous statistics for opponent teams (OOBP),\r\naverage number of bases players earn per at bat in a given season\r\n(SLG - Slugging Percentage) and analogous statistics for\r\nopponent teams (OSLG).\r\nIn terms of time, we will work with data from the years 1996-2001,\r\nwhich precede 2002, when the story of Moneyball mostly takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading set of libraries for data manipulation and visualization\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\nbaseball <- readr::read_csv(\"./baseball.csv\")\r\n\r\n# filtering data used for the analysis\r\nmyData <- baseball %>%\r\n  dplyr::filter(\r\n    Year < 2002, \r\n    Year > 1995\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::select(Team, OBP, SLG, OOBP, OSLG, RS, RA, W, Playoffs)\r\n\r\n# user-friendly table with data used for the analysis\r\nDT::datatable(\r\n  myData,\r\n  class = 'cell-border stripe', \r\n  filter = 'top',\r\n  extensions = 'Buttons',\r\n  fillContainer = FALSE,\r\n  rownames= FALSE,\r\n  options = list(\r\n    pageLength = 5, \r\n    autoWidth = TRUE,\r\n    dom = 'Bfrtip',\r\n    buttons = c('copy'), \r\n    scrollX = TRUE, \r\n    selection=\"multiple\"\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let’s define a formal model of the OAK and fit it to the data\r\nusing the brms R\r\npackage which allows us to make inferences about the model\r\nparameters within a Bayesian\r\ninferential framework. Specifically, we will build and fit a\r\nso-called path\r\nanalysis model, which is a special type of structural equation\r\nmodeling used to describe directed dependencies among a set of\r\nvariables. Given that we have data for a group of the same teams over\r\nseveral seasons, we must also incorporate the hierarchical nature of the\r\ndata into the model.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries for fitting Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan for full Bayesian inference\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\r\n\r\n# specifying individual parts of the SEM (without modeling the correlation between response variables and using Student's t distribution instead of the Gaussian distribution to make the model more robust) \r\na <- brms::bf(W ~ 1 + RS + RA + (1 + RS + RA | Team), family = student())\r\nb <- brms::bf(RA ~ 1 + OOBP + OSLG + (1 + OOBP + OSLG | Team), family = student())\r\nc <- brms::bf(RS ~ 1 + OBP + SLG + (1 + OBP + SLG | Team), family = student())\r\nd <- brms::bf(Playoffs ~ 1 + W + (1 + W | Team), family = bernoulli())\r\n\r\n# fitting the model\r\nfit <- brms::brm(\r\n  a + b + c + d + set_rescor(FALSE), \r\n  data = myData,\r\n  iter = 3000,\r\n  chains = 3,\r\n  warmup = 500,\r\n  thin = 1,\r\n  seed = 123,\r\n  cores = 5,\r\n  backend = \"cmdstanr\",\r\n  refresh = 0,\r\n  silent = 2 \r\n  )\r\n\r\n# checking MCMC convergence\r\n# plot(fit)\r\n# summary(fit)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter verifying that the mechanics of the MCMC algorithm work well\r\n(not shown here for brevity reasons), we should also verify how well the\r\nmodel fits the data by using the posterior predictive check for each of\r\nthe observed response variables in our model.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for arbitrarily complex composition of ggplot plots\r\nlibrary(patchwork)\r\n\r\n# posterior predictive check for all predicted observed variables \r\nplayoffsPpc <- brms::pp_check(fit, resp = \"Playoffs\", ndraws = 100) + ggplot2::labs(title = \"Playoffs variable\")\r\nwPpc <- brms::pp_check(fit, resp = \"W\", ndraws = 100) + ggplot2::labs(title = \"W variable\")\r\nrsPpc <- brms::pp_check(fit, resp = \"RS\", ndraws = 100) + ggplot2::labs(title = \"RS variable\")\r\nraPpc <- brms::pp_check(fit, resp = \"RA\", ndraws = 100) + ggplot2::labs(title = \"RA variable\")\r\n\r\nppc <- (playoffsPpc + wPpc) / (rsPpc + raPpc)\r\n\r\nprint(ppc)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the model fits the data pretty well. Now we can look\r\nat the coefficients in the individual parts of the model. All of them\r\nshow non-zero values and are in directions that are consistent with our\r\nexpectations embodied in our conceptual model, i.e., all are positive\r\nexcept for the coefficient of the RA variable (number of points\r\nlost) as a predictor of the number of games won (W). These\r\nresults thus give us greater confidence in following our conceptual\r\nmodel of team functioning when making decisions about allocating our\r\nlimited resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for plotting functions for posterior analysis, MCMC diagnostics, prior and posterior predictive checks, and other visualizations to support the applied Bayesian workflow\r\nlibrary(bayesplot)\r\n\r\n# getting overview of all parameters \r\n# get_variables(fit)\r\n# relevant parameters: \"b_RS_OBP\", \"b_RS_SLG\", \"b_RA_OOBP\", \"b_RA_OSLG\", \"b_W_RS\", \"b_W_RA\", \"b_Playoffs_W\"\r\n\r\nb_RS_OBP <- bayesplot::mcmc_areas(\r\n  fit, \r\n  pars = \"b_RS_OBP\", \r\n  prob = 0.95,\r\n  point_est = \"median\"\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"OBP variable in the RS ~ OBP part\"\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nb_RS_SLG <- bayesplot::mcmc_areas(\r\n  fit, \r\n  pars = \"b_RS_SLG\", \r\n  prob = 0.95,\r\n  point_est = \"median\"\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"SLG variable in the RS ~ SLG part\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nb_RA_OOBP <- bayesplot::mcmc_areas(\r\n  fit, \r\n  pars = \"b_RA_OOBP\", \r\n  prob = 0.95,\r\n  point_est = \"median\"\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"OOBP variable in the RA ~ OOBP part\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nb_RA_OSLG <- bayesplot::mcmc_areas(\r\n  fit, \r\n  pars = \"b_RA_OSLG\", \r\n  prob = 0.95,\r\n  point_est = \"median\"\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"OSLG variable in the RA ~ OSLG part\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nb_W_RS <- bayesplot::mcmc_areas(\r\n  fit, \r\n  pars = \"b_W_RS\", \r\n  prob = 0.95,\r\n  point_est = \"median\"\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"RS variable in the W ~ RS part\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nb_W_RA <- bayesplot::mcmc_areas(\r\n  fit, \r\n  pars = \"b_W_RA\", \r\n  prob = 0.95,\r\n  point_est = \"median\"\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"RA variable in the W ~ RA part\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nb_Playoffs_W <- bayesplot::mcmc_areas(\r\n  fit, \r\n  pars = \"b_Playoffs_W\", \r\n  prob = 0.95,\r\n  point_est = \"median\"\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"W variable in the Playoffs ~ W part\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\ncoefCharts <- (b_RS_OBP + b_RS_SLG + b_RA_OOBP) / (b_RA_OSLG + b_W_RS + b_W_RA) / (b_Playoffs_W + patchwork::plot_spacer() + patchwork::plot_spacer()) +\r\n  plot_annotation(\r\n    title = 'Posterior interval estimations',\r\n    caption = \"The solid vertical lines represent the point (median) estimates and the shaded areas represent the 95% credible interval.\",\r\n    theme = theme(\r\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 18),\r\n      plot.caption = element_text(size = 11)\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n\r\nprint(coefCharts)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# summary of the fitted model  \r\nsummary(fit)\r\n\r\n\r\n Family: MV(student, student, student, bernoulli) \r\n  Links: mu = identity;

Because competing teams underestimated the\r\nimportance of these player statistics and overestimated other, less\r\nimportant variables (e.g., batting average), OAK management was able to\r\npurchase players relatively inexpensively who enabled them to achieve\r\ntheir goals. As a result, the OAK won 20 more games per season than\r\nsimilarly “poor” teams and about the same number of games as 2 to 3\r\ntimes richer competition.

Btw, you can give it a try\r\nbecause many of its features are available for free on the Google Workspace\r\nMarketplace.\r\nWe are currently trying to connect these two “worlds” because in\r\nsituations of organizational transformation it can be very useful to\r\nhave information about the relationship between the current and/or\r\nintended formal structure of the organization on the one hand and the\r\nactual patterns of collaboration on the other.\r\nOne option we’re considering is using a kind of heatmap, which you\r\nmay be familiar with from eye-tracking studies used in marketing, to see\r\nwhere people focus their attention when interacting with products and\r\nmaking purchasing decisions. Now imagine if we overlayed a similar\r\nheatmap showing the intensity of collaboration between a selected unit\r\nand the rest of the organization over an org chart - see the figure\r\nbelow for illustration.\r\n\r\nWould you consider such a visualization useful if you were engaged in\r\norganizational transformation? Would you suggest any other kind of\r\nvisualization or specific metric related to collaboration? Thank you in\r\nadvance for any input you may have - it will help us broaden the range\r\nof perspectives we are currently considering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nIn determining the “optimal” span of control (SOC) for the company\r\nand specific departments and teams, it is always advisable to consider\r\nthe context and strategy of the company, the way in which individual\r\ndepartments and teams should perform their work, and the level of\r\ncompetence of individual managers.\r\nFor example, McKinsey\r\nsuggested the following four specific aspects of managerial complexity\r\nthat should be considered in this endeavor:\r\nThe time a manager spends doing her or his own work vs. managing\r\nothers.\r\nThe extent to which the work process is not standardized and\r\nformally structured.\r\nThe variety of work of the manager’s direct reports.\r\nThe amount of experience and training that team members need to do\r\ntheir jobs.\r\nThe more of the above, the smaller the SOC should be.\r\nIn addition to these factors, we can use as other useful inputs some\r\nmeasures of collaboration that can reasonably be expected to be related\r\nboth to SOC and to the obligations that managers have to their direct\r\nreports. A good example is the metric of the number of 1-on-1 meetings\r\nthat managers have with their direct reports. As the attached chart\r\nillustrates, when pitted against each other, we can look for points on\r\nthe SOC scale where managers start to fall short of the goal of a\r\ncertain minimum number of 1:1s they have with their people, e.g. 2\r\nmeetings per month.\r\n\r\nWhat factors do you typically consider when determining the optimal\r\nspan of control in your company? And do you regularly reassess the\r\nadequacy of the current SOC in the context of your current\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nAs many of you can probably confess, Slack and other instant\r\nmessaging (IM) platforms can be both a blessing and a curse. To support\r\nthe former and suppress the latter, authors of these tools and their\r\nusers themselves have come up with several recommendations on how to use\r\nthem effectively.\r\nSpecific numbers can be attached to some of these best practices to\r\nhelp teams and entire companies systematically shape their behavior on\r\nIM platforms in the desired direction. At Time Is Ltd., we currently measure\r\nthe following seven best practices:\r\nThread use: It helps create organized discussions\r\naround specific messages, and they let users discuss a topic in more\r\ndetail without adding clutter to a channel or direct message\r\nconversation.\r\nMention use: Mentioning specific people in messages\r\nin both public and private channels is one effective way to avoid\r\noverwhelming users with a large number of messages that are not relevant\r\nto them.\r\nShort messages use: Shorter messages often mean\r\nmore messages, more messages mean more notifications, and more\r\nnotifications mean more distractions, more frequent context switching,\r\nand decreased productivity.\r\nEmoji use: People should use emojis instead of\r\nshort messages as they are less distracting and more friendly to other\r\npeople’s attention.\r\nBatching: Responding to chat messages round the\r\nclock can be detrimental to employees’ productivity as it can distract\r\nthem from focused work. Better strategy is checking messages every one\r\nor two hours instead of continuous handling of all incoming\r\nmessages.\r\nInactive channels: Non-archived channels that show\r\nno activity are just clutter that makes it difficult to navigate and\r\ncollaborate on the chat platform.\r\nTransparency: Direct and group messages have their\r\nplace in chat, especially when discussing sensitive issues or when\r\ntrying to avoid spamming other employees. However, when majority of chat\r\ncommunication occurs in direct and group messages, there is a higher\r\nrisk that information important for task alignment, problem-solving, or\r\ndecision will be hidden in them and out of view from relevant\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWould you add some other best practices for IM that have worked well\r\nfor you and that would make sense to measure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nWhen dealing with a large number of tasks and frequent task\r\nswitching, two related concepts originating from computer science can be\r\nused: batch\r\nprocessing and interrupt\r\ncoalescing.\r\nIn computing, these terms refer to a situation where computers wait\r\nuntil a fixed interval and check everything, rather than contextually\r\nswitching and processing separate, uncoordinated interrupts from their\r\nvarious sub-components.\r\nWhen transposed into the world of human workers, this design\r\nprinciple can manifest in checking emails or instant messages every one\r\nor two hours instead of continuously handling all incoming emails and\r\nmessages. Such an arrangement prevents fragmentation of people’s time\r\nand provides them with more focus time they need for deep work and\r\nexperiencing flow.\r\nBut how to measure this behavior so that a number can be put on it to\r\nenable people to better shape their behavior in this regard? At Time is\r\nLtd. we are currently experimenting with two different approaches:\r\nClustering of sent emails/messages using K-Means or PAM and calculation\r\nof time gaps between start/end points of identified clusters, including\r\nthe start and end of the working day. The larger the gaps, the stronger\r\nthe signal of batch behavior.\r\nPercentage of emails/messages sent during the 3 busiest working\r\nhours (defined by the number of emails/messages sent) during a given\r\nday. The higher the proportion, the stronger the signal of batch\r\nbehavior. This approach is inspired by the 2016\r\nstudy by Mark et al. “Email Duration, Batching and\r\nSelf-interruption: Patterns of Email Use on Productivity and Stress”,\r\nwhere the authors used similar approach in the domain of email\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both methods (face\r\nvalidity, accuracy, sensitivity to edge cases, computational complexity,\r\netc.), but irrespective of these, which one would you prefer to see in\r\nyour collaboration report? To get a better idea of what outputs both of\r\nthe above approaches generate, you can take a look at the attached\r\ngraphs showing the prevalence of batch behavior during one of my work\r\nweeks on Slack according to these two approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The fact that more than 140 people completed the test allowed\r\nme to compare our current results with those of the participants in the\r\noriginal study (959 HR practitioners, mostly HR managers, with an\r\naverage of 13.8 years of HR experience).\r\nSo how did we do overall?\r\nOn average, we had 19.4 items out of 35 correct, i.e., we had a 55%\r\nsuccess rate, which is very close to the results of the original study\r\nwhere respondents had an average 57% success rate (and also pretty close\r\nto the 50% success rate corresponding to random choice). So these\r\nresults suggest that we have not progressed much as a group over the\r\nlast 20 years, however, see the disclaimer at the very end of the\r\npost.\r\n\r\nIn which HRM area did we have the largest & smallest\r\nknowledge gaps?\r\nThe biggest gap was in the staffing area (44% success rate) and the\r\nsmallest was in the training & employee development area (67%\r\nsuccess rate).\r\nIn which items did we do best?\r\nLeadership training is effective because good leaders are made, not\r\nborn (95% success rate).\r\nLecture-based training is not generally superior to other forms of\r\ntraining delivery (92% success rate).\r\nWhen pay must be reduced or frozen, a company can do something to\r\nreduce employee dissatisfaction and dysfunctional behaviors (90% success\r\nrate).\r\nIn which items did we do the worst?\r\nScoring positive on drug tests doesn’t mean one will be any less\r\nreliable or productive employee (11.6% success rate).\r\nSetting performance goals is, on average, more effective for\r\nimproving organizational performance than encouraging employees to\r\nparticipate in decision-making (12.3% success rate).\r\nMost errors in performance appraisals cannot be eliminated by\r\nproviding training that describes the kinds of errors managers tend to\r\nmake and suggesting ways to avoid them (15% success rate).\r\nIn which items were we most unsure?\r\nOlder adults don’t learn more from training than younger adults (38%\r\nuncertain).\r\nIntegrity tests that try to predict whether someone will steal, be\r\nabsent, or otherwise take advantage of an employer work well in practice\r\n(34% uncertain).\r\nCompanies with merit pay systems tend to have higher performance\r\nthan companies without them (17% uncertain).\r\nPlease keep in mind that the comparison presented here is not\r\nentirely an apples-to-apples comparison due to several limitations of\r\nthe data collection method (e.g., we don’t know the sociodemographics of\r\nthe new participants, new evidence may have emerged that does not match\r\nthe correct answers in the original study, some people may have taken\r\nthe test multiple times, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You can also use it to check the accuracy of your answers at the item level to fill in specific gaps in your knowledge.\r\nHere is the link to the app.\r\nFeel free to share your results in the comments. Think of it as a form of public commitment to making some progress in evidence-based HRM in the coming year 😉 To walk the talk, I attached my own results. As you can see, it’s not bad, but there is still room for improvement, especially in the general employment practices area 😃\r\n\r\nP.S. Keep in mind that the test is based on evidence available up to 2002, so it is possible that some correct answers or their contingencies may have changed in that time. For all of them, consider, for example, the adjustment of the estimate of the magnitude of the predictive validity of personnel selection procedures in their most recent meta-analysis by Sackett et al. (2022). If you come across any such discrepancy, it would be great if you share it with others in the comments.\r\nUpdate: With more than 140 people completing the test, I was able to compare our current results with those of the participants in the original study. You can see the results of the comparison in the post Evaluation of the results of the evidence-based HRM knowledge test. Spoiler: It’s not very good 😯\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As the first chart illustrates, on more than 75% of vacation days\r\npeople show some collaborative activity, here measured by attending\r\nnon-recurring meetings, sending emails, and editing shared files.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same data also suggests what could be part of the remedy\r\nfor this unsatisfactory state of affairs. The second chart shows that\r\nthere is a small but not insignificant positive relationship between the\r\ntime that managers and their direct reports spend collaborating during\r\nvacation. The chart also shows that managers tend to collaborate more\r\nintensely during vacation than their direct reports, which is probably\r\nnot too much of a surprise.\r\n\r\nThe data is thus in line with the quite often mentioned suggestion\r\nthat managers should be better role models for their direct reports on\r\nhow to behave during vacation.

    "contents": "\r\nSince the beginning of our efforts at Time is Ltd. to develop a\r\ncomprehensive collaboration analytics platform, we have created several\r\nhundred collaboration metrics. As you can probably imagine, with such a\r\nhuge amount of metrics, it was quite difficult for users to get\r\nsomething useful out of the platform.\r\nTo make the metrics provided more digestible, we’ve enhanced the\r\nplatform using several approaches, from simply selecting metrics with\r\nthe most straightforward call to action and creating apps for very\r\nspecific use cases to providing users with comparative, historical,\r\nintuitively scaled, and equivalent information. Brent Dykes described\r\nmany of these sense-making methods very neatly in his article Contextualized\r\nInsights: Six Ways To Put Your Numbers In Context.\r\nHowever, even after several rounds of these improvements, there was\r\nstill a need to help users quickly find areas that might be worth their\r\nattention and deeper exploration. One approach we took was based on the\r\n(validated) assumption that collaboration metrics are relatively stable\r\nover time and that the intentional and unintentional behavioral changes\r\nbehind these metrics evolve rather slowly. We therefore decided to\r\ndetect the most significant changes over the last 3 months.\r\nFor this purpose, we chose a method that is related to the Bollinger Bands\r\nmethod used in time series analysis or “Heartbeat Analysis” used in\r\nsurvey response analysis. Specifically, we look at the standard\r\ndeviation and average of the month-to-month changes for each metric,\r\nscale the changes to z-scores, and then identify the metrics with the\r\nhighest absolute value of average change over the last 3 months. To\r\nillustrate, see the attached chart where the metrics are sorted by\r\nmagnitude of their change in descending order from left to right and top\r\nto bottom.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try this method on your own data, you can use its\r\nPython implementation, which is on my\r\nGitHub page.\r\nWhat other methods do you find useful in identifying values or\r\nchanges that might be worth users’ attention? Feel free to share them in\r\nthe comments for inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nI assume many, if not all, of you are familiar with the\r\nEisenhower matrix, a simple tool for prioritizing tasks based on a\r\ncombination of their importance and urgency. It assumes 4 types of tasks\r\n- important & urgent, important & not urgent, not important\r\n& urgent, not important & not urgent - and for each of them\r\noffers a simple recommendation on what to do with them - do it, schedule\r\nit, delegate it, and delete it. By following these rules, people should\r\nbe able to more successfully combat the “mere-urgency” effect, eliminate\r\ntime-wasters in their lives, and create more space to make progress\r\ntoward their goals.\r\n\r\nSomething similar can be created also for meetings, which are big\r\ntime and money guzzlers and deserve to be treated accordingly. Only\r\ninstead of the dimensions of importance and urgency, we will use the\r\nsize and length of meetings. The resulting matrix assumes 4 types of\r\nmeetings with corresponding recommendations on what to do with them:\r\nSmall & Short: These meetings are a bit tricky\r\nbecause they often involve useful meetings, e.g., short syncs of teams\r\nworking on some specific task or project or one-on-one meetings between\r\nmanagers and their direct reports, however, when there is a lot of them,\r\nthey may cause calendar fragmentation and drop in available focus time;\r\nto avoid this, one can think of batching such meetings into larger\r\nblocks of two or three meetings with appropriate small breaks in between\r\nto avoid meeting fatigue and late arrivals.\r\nSmall & Long: These meetings are great for\r\nbrainstorming, problem-solving, or decision-making, so make sure you use\r\nthem primarily for that purpose and don’t waste them on low-value-added\r\nactivities.\r\nLarge & Short: These meetings often serve only\r\nto disseminate information and can therefore be safely replaced by less\r\nintrusive asynchronous collaboration tools such as email, instant\r\nmessaging or some kind of knowledge management tool.\r\nLarge & Long: These meetings are quite often a\r\nwaste of people’s time by not allowing everyone to meaningfully\r\ncontribute and by making them both physically and mentally exhausted, so\r\ntry to move these meetings into the third quadrant if your goal is\r\nsimple information dissemination or into the second quadrant if the goal\r\nis to solve some problem or to make some important decision.\r\nThe meeting matrix is by no means a panacea for meeting overload, but\r\nby following the rules above, people should be able to better protect\r\ntheir time for focused work and make meetings more efficient,\r\nmeaningful, and valuable for themselves and the company. Just be aware\r\nthat unlike the Eisenhower matrix, in the case of the meeting matrix,\r\npeople need to rely more on others to follow these rules in order for\r\nits positive effect to materialize. So get ready to update your\r\n(hopefully already existing) team agreement on your collaboration\r\nculture.\r\nBtw, what is your guess as to how much time you spend in each cell of\r\nthe meeting matrix? For comparison I attach my monthly numbers from\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As useful as it is to know which interventions have a\r\ndecent chance of reducing gender pay inequality, an integral part of\r\nthis fight is to regularly check the existence of this inequality across\r\nthe organisation and within different types of organisational processes.\r\nAs Alessandro\r\nLinari aptly noted in a discussion on Linkedin, “The best way to\r\nkeep the gender pay gap under control is still to do a periodic pay\r\nequity analysis across the organisation and address any identified gap.\r\nI say unfortunately because there are a thousand different ways where\r\npay differences still manage to sneak into the workforce, through hiring\r\nand promotion practices, but also retention policies, bonus allocation,\r\nperformance management, and others.” If you want to learn more\r\nabout some of the technical details of such an analysis, check out one\r\nof my previous posts on this topic (unfortunately, it is now only\r\navailable in Czech, but you can use one of the online translators to get\r\naround this limitation 😉).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For many job roles, especially\r\nknowledge-based ones, job performance has a power-law distribution,\r\ni.e., only a few percent of individuals or teams have disproportionately\r\nhigh performance and most have performance below the statistical average\r\n(many of you have probably heard of Pareto’s law, and the 80/20 rule in\r\nthis context). More detailed information on this particular topic can be\r\nfound, for example, in the following two articles - The\r\nBest and the Rest: Revisiting the Norm of Normality of Individual\r\nPerformance by O’Boyle Jr. & Aguinis (2012) and Team\r\nPerformance: Nature and Antecedents of Nonnormal Distributions by\r\nBradley & Aguinis (2022).\r\nWhy bother with that? Well, because, based on incorrect assumptions\r\nabout the distribution of specific phenomena, companies may make\r\ndecisions that ultimately harm them. For example, suppose a company\r\napplies the assumption of normal distribution in evaluating employees’\r\nperformance that actually has power law distribution. In that case, it\r\nwill result in underestimating the contribution of the best performers\r\nand overestimating the contribution of the worst performers, which may\r\nbe negatively reflected in various decisions regarding reward &\r\ncompensation, learning & development, promotions, succession\r\nplanning, etc.\r\nLessons learned? For frequent decisions or decisions with a\r\nsignificant expected impact, it is worth checking that our underlying\r\nassumptions match reality.\r\nBtw, this also applies to personal life. Here’s an example from mine:\r\nI thought I was in control of watching movies and TV shows on streaming\r\nplatforms, but I started getting signals from those around me that I was\r\nspending too much time there. So as a proper ‘Quantified Selfer’, I decided to\r\ntrack my daily screen time for a month. To my surprise, I found that I\r\nwas indeed spending a lot more time there than I thought and wished. I\r\nthen put in place simple solutions to prevent me from watching more than\r\nI should - I have started to pay extra fees into the family budget for\r\nwatching movies (loss aversion), I\r\nhave pre-selected time slots for watching movies (implementation\r\nintention), I’ve removed streaming apps from my phone (lowering salience),\r\nI’ve stopped watching movies alone (social control), and I’m also\r\nplaying with the idea of asking my wife to change the PINs (preventing\r\nimpulsive\r\nwatching).\r\nP.S. If you ever need to check the shape distribution of any of your\r\nmetrics, you should definitely try the amazing fitdistrplus\r\nR package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nWhen trying to reduce uncertainty, even very small pieces of\r\ninformation count if you are patient and have some tool to combine them\r\neffectively. I recently re-read Philip\r\nTetlock’s book Superforecasting\r\nand came across an excellent illustration of such a tool: Bayesian belief\r\nupdating.\r\n“Imagine you are sitting with your back to a billiards table. A\r\nfriend rolls a ball onto the table and it stops at a random spot. You\r\nwant to locate the ball without looking. How? Your friend rolls a second\r\nball, which stops at another random spot. You ask, “Is the second ball\r\nto the left or the right of the first?” Your friend says, “To the left.”\r\nThat’s an almost trivial scrap of information. But it’s not nothing. It\r\ntells you that the first ball is not on the extreme left edge of the\r\ntable. And it makes it just a tad more likely that the first ball is on\r\nthe right side of the table. If your friend rolls another ball on the\r\ntable and the procedure is repeated, you get another scrap of\r\ninformation. If he says, “It’s to the left,” the likelihood of the first\r\nball being on the right side of the table increases a little more. Keep\r\nrepeating the process and you slowly narrow the range of the possible\r\nlocations, zeroing in on the truth—although you will never eliminate\r\nuncertainty entirely.”\r\nAfter reading this paragraph, I thought it would be much more\r\npedagogically compelling (and fun 😉) to see this update process live\r\nand in action.

    "contents": "\r\nWhile cleaning out my (very) old computer, I came across a hidden\r\ngem: a dataset with real-world data about police cadet evaluation. It\r\nwas part of a tutorial from Peltarion, an AI\r\nsoftware company providing specialized software (Synapse) for\r\ncreating, training, evaluating, and deploying artificial neural networks\r\nand other adaptive systems (recently acquired by King). AFAIK,\r\nthis dataset is not part of any publicly available database with\r\ntraining datasets, so it may add a bit to the portfolio of possibilities\r\nfor those involved and interested in people analytics.\r\nThe data were collected as part of an effort by the National\r\nPolice Services Agency and the Dutch\r\nMinistry of Justice and Security to objectively examine whether the\r\ndata collected at the time of graduation of police cadets can be used to\r\npredict the requirements for passing the standard five-year evaluation.\r\nThe main reason for the study was to find the key indicators for the\r\nthen 20% failure rate, which was considered unacceptable (data were\r\ncollected in the late 1990s), and to study the effects of lowering\r\nadmission standards (accepting cadets with past criminal records and\r\nlowering the minimum grade from 5.5 to 4.0).\r\nThe dataset has the following characteristics:\r\n2000 observations\r\n9 attributes:\r\nAge: the age at which the cadet started studying to\r\nbecome a police officer.\r\nAvG: average grade at the time of graduation (scale\r\n1-10).\r\nChdn: number of children at the time of\r\ngraduation.\r\nExEd: extra university-level or equivalent\r\neducation (years).\r\nCR: criminal record (0=No, 1=Yes).\r\nSex: sex of the cadet (0 = Male, 1 = Female).\r\nSecE: other experience in the security sector (0 =\r\nNo, 1 = Yes).\r\nAvgE: average yearly evaluation score (The average\r\nof five years.

To answer\r\nher question properly, we should avoid comparing apples with pears and\r\ncontrol for the effect of the number of collaborative activities people\r\nparticipate in, as it can be assumed that those who spend more time\r\ncollaborating with others have less time for focused work and also use\r\nthe timeboxing technique more.\r\nUsing this approach and our clients’ collaborative data, I looked at\r\nthe relationship between the proportion of work time blocked on the\r\ncalendar and the time available for focused work (i.e. no meetings, no\r\nad-hoc calls, no email or instant messaging), and found that the\r\nmarginal effect of timeboxing is in line with the positive effect of the\r\ntimeboxing technique on the time available for focused work. The effect\r\nis not huge (each percentage point of working time blocked in the\r\ncalendar yields on average .19% of focus rate), however, timeboxing\r\nseems to be saved, phew 😉\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nIn one of our projects,\r\nwhere we were trying to find out how collaborative behavior relates to\r\nemployee engagement, we repeatedly came across patterns that reminded\r\nthe client of internally well-known differences between the behavior of\r\nteams from different parts of the company. For example, we found that\r\nmore frequent participation in short and small meetings was related to\r\nlower employee engagement. This pattern matched well the client’s\r\nobservation that one particular part of the company had regular daily\r\nstand-up meetings and also lower engagement scores compared to the rest\r\nof the company due to some other aspects of their work. As further\r\nanalysis confirmed, this pattern was really just a statistical artifact\r\ncaused by the coincidence of these two facts.\r\nOne way analysts can protect themselves from this type of misleading\r\nconclusions is by using multilevel or hierarchical\r\nmodels that take into account the fact that the data\r\nhave a nested structure, i.e. that some observations are not\r\nindependent of each other because they belong to the same higher-order\r\ngroup, e.g. to an organizational unit (one of the basic assumptions of\r\nmost statistical models in use).\r\nThis is well illustrated in the graphs below. They show that the\r\nrelationship between the number of monthly 1:1s that employees have with\r\ntheir line manager and their subjectively perceived support from their\r\nline manager is slightly

In this particular case, it is relatively easy to\r\nrecognize that something may be wrong, but the situation is not always\r\nso obvious and intuitive. In these other cases, it is advantageous to\r\nhave some tool at hand to compensate for our imperfect intuition and\r\nlimited knowledge and imagination.

If you work with R, you can use the lme4\r\nor brms\r\npackages to implement it. In a Python\r\nenvironment, you can use the statsmodels or\r\nPyMC3 libraries to\r\ndo this. And if you’re more used to drag-and-drop tools, then JASP or jamovi (both open-source alternatives\r\nto SPSS)\r\nwill give you access to various mixed models through an easy-to-use\r\ngraphical interface.\r\nFor an accessible discussion of this topic in the context of people\r\nanalytics, including other useful tools for working with hierarchical\r\ndata, see also the excellent articles by Paul van der\r\nLaken, John\r\nLipinski, and Max\r\nBlumberg:\r\nSimpson’s\r\nParadox: Two HR examples with R code.\r\nHow\r\nto Avoid Aggregation Errors and Simpson’s Paradox in HR Analytics: Part\r\n1\r\nHow\r\nto Avoid Aggregation Errors and Simpson’s Paradox in HR Analytics: Part\r\n2\r\nWhy\r\nPeople Analytics should NOT be using regression to predict team\r\noutcomes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This motivated me to look\r\nat existing research on this topic to help us better set our apriori\r\nexpectations on this issue.\r\nWith the help of metaBus, an\r\namazing platform for curating, searching, and summarizing research\r\nfindings from the social and organizational sciences, I was able to get\r\nthe results of over 100 studies on the relationship between employees’\r\nBig\r\n5 personality traits and the amount of interaction and networking\r\nbehavior they engage in. Among the criteria for the amount of\r\ninteraction were variables like contact frequency, frequency of\r\nparticipation, communication frequency, meeting frequency, hours of\r\ninteraction, interaction duration, etc. For networking behavior there\r\nwere criteria as liaison, building networks, relationship building,\r\nnetwork activity, maintaining contacts, increasing internal visibility,\r\nnetwork ability, and informal network.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# The following concepts were used to search for relevant studies on the metaBus platform (their respective codes are

The greater the difference between the\r\ntwo in favor of inbound collaboration activities, the stronger the\r\nsignal that collaboration overload and/or bottlenecks may be a problem\r\nfor that team or individual.\r\nTo illustrate, take a look at the attached charts that show the\r\npatterns of collaboration between several teams via Slack. The distances\r\nbetween teams, the thickness, and the direction of the arrows between\r\nthem tell us who is collaborating with whom and how much. The size of\r\nthe nodes then represents the amount of inbound and outbound\r\ncollaborative activities that the teams participate in, respectively.\r\nBased on the differences between them, the bar

(You can replicate this chart using the Google Trends website and the search terms, time range, location, and source for searches described above. If you are familiar with R, you can use the code below.)\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for getting data from Google Trends\r\nlibrary(gtrendsR)\r\n# uploading libraries for data manipulation\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\n\r\n# setting parameters for Google Trends\r\nsearchTerms   <- c(\"people analytics\", \"hr analytics\")\r\nlocation      <- \"\" # global\r\ntime          <- \"2007-01-01 2022-07-31\"\r\nsource         <- \"web\"\r\n\r\n# getting Google Trends data\r\ngtrendsResult <- gtrendsR::gtrends(\r\n    keyword = searchTerms, \r\n    geo     = location, \r\n    time    = time,\r\n    gprop   = source\r\n    )\r\n\r\n# cleaning data\r\ngtrendsResultDf <- gtrendsResult %>%\r\n    purrr::pluck(\"interest_over_time\") %>%\r\n    dplyr::select(date, hits, keyword) %>%\r\n    dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the time series, somewhere between September 2019 and March 2020, it seems that the trend stops increasing and starts to stagnate, except for the very last part of the graph, which shows a sharp increase in searches for both terms, but this may just be the result of the improved data collection system from January 2022 onwards (as indicated by the vertical line in the graph with a note). Thus, the data seems to suggest the opposite of what we would expect if a pandemic were to have a positive effect on interest in people analytics.\r\nHowever, after combining the results for the two search terms and plotting them on a graph together with the unadjusted regression trend lines, the resulting picture gives a slightly different impression. There appears to be little to no decline in interest in people analytics immediately after the pandemic outbreak, but a steeper slope of change after the pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# normalize function\r\nnormalize <- function(x) {\r\n  return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\ngtrendsResultDf %>%\r\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = \"keyword\", values_from = \"hits\") %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    interestInPeopleAnalytics = `people analytics` + `hr analytics`,\r\n    interestInPeopleAnalytics = normalize(interestInPeopleAnalytics)*100\r\n  ) %>%\r\n    # creating new pandemic variable \r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    pandemic = case_when(\r\n      date >= '2020-03-01' ~ \"After the pandemic outbreak\",\r\n      TRUE ~ \"Before the pandemic outbreak\"\r\n    )\r\n  )%>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = date, y = interestInPeopleAnalytics, color = pandemic)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\", end = 0.8, name = \"\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_x_date(breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    x = \"\",\r\n    y = \"Interest in people analytics\",\r\n    title = \"Interest in people analytics before and after the pandemic outbreak\",\r\n    caption = \"The solid lines represent unadjusted regression model trend lines before and after the pandemic outbreak.\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggthemes::theme_clean() +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\r\n    legend.background = element_blank()\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make the picture a little bit clearer, let us take the help of inferential statistics to answer the question we are interested in. The ideal analytical tool for our use case is a segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series that enables estimation of the changes in levels and trends of search interest before and after after a known ‘intervention’ or ‘interruption’ (i.e., a change that could potentially affect the outcome variable). It does so by segmenting the time series data into different periods based on the known interruption points and modeling these segments separately. The model used has the following general structure:\r\n\\[Y_{t} = β_{0} + β_{1}*time_{t} + β_{2}*intervention_{t} + β_{3}*time after intervention_{t} + e_{t}\\]\r\nThe β0 coefficient estimates the baseline level of the outcome variable at time zero; β1 coefficient estimates the change in the mean of the outcome variable that occurs with each unit of time before the intervention (i.e. the baseline trend); β2 coefficient estimates the level change in the mean of the outcome variable immediately after the intervention (i.e. from the end of the preceding segment); and β3 estimates the change in the trend in the mean of the outcome variable per unit of time after the intervention, compared with the trend before the intervention (thus, the sum of β1 and β3 equals to the post-intervention slope). For a better understanding of the model, take a look at the illustrative chart taken from Turner et al. (2021) below.\r\n\r\nSince we are dealing with correlated and truncated data, we should also include two additional terms in our model, an autocorrelation term and a truncation term, to handle these specific properties of our data.\r\nData preparation\r\nBut first, let’s prepare the data we will need for this type of analysis. Specifically, we will need the following five variables:\r\nsearch interest in people analytics – numerical variable representing search interest in people analytics relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time; this variable is truncated within the interval between values of 0 and 100; a value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term; a value of 50 means that the term is half as popular; a score of 0 means that there was not enough data for this term; search interest for two monitored terms (“people analytics” and “HR analytics”) was combined by simple summation and then normalized to a range of 0 to 100; this variable serves as a dependent (criterion) variable;\r\nelapsed time – numerical variable representing the number of months that elapsed from the beginning of the time series; this variable enables estimation of the size and direction of the overall trend in the data before the intervention;\r\npandemic – dichotomic variable indicating the presence/absence of pandemic; as already mentioned above, for the purpose of this analysis, the beginning of the pandemic is assumed to have started in March 2020; this variable enables estimation of the level change in the interest in people analytics immediately after the pandemic outbreak;\r\nelapsed time after pandemic outbreak – numerical variable representing the number of months that elapsed from the beginning of pandemic; this variable enables estimation of the change in the trend in the interest in people analytics after the outbreak of pandemic;\r\nmonth – categorical variable representing specific month within a year; this variable enables controlling for the effect of seasonality.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# munging data\r\nmydata <- gtrendsResultDf %>%\r\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = \"keyword\", values_from = \"hits\") %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    interestInPeopleAnalytics = `people analytics` + `hr analytics`,\r\n    interestInPeopleAnalytics = normalize(interestInPeopleAnalytics)*100,\r\n    month = lubridate::month(date,label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE),\r\n    month = factor(month, levels = c(\"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\"), labels = c(\"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\", \"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\"), ordered = FALSE)\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  # arranging data in ascending order by date\r\n  dplyr::arrange(date) %>%\r\n    # creating new variables elapsed time, pandemic, and time elapsed after pandemic outbreak\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    elapsedTime = row_number(),\r\n    pandemic = case_when(\r\n      date >= '2020-03-01' ~ 1,\r\n      TRUE ~ 0\r\n    ),\r\n    elapsedTimeAfterPandemic = cumsum(pandemic),\r\n    pandemic = as.factor(ifelse(pandemic == 1, \"After the pandemic outbreak\", \"Before the pandemic outbreak\"))\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  # final selection of variables\r\n  dplyr::select(\r\n    date, interestInPeopleAnalytics, elapsedTime, month, pandemic, elapsedTimeAfterPandemic\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a table with the resulting data we will use for our analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for making more user-friendly data table\r\nlibrary(DT)\r\n\r\nDT::datatable(\r\n  mydata,\r\n  class = 'cell-border stripe', \r\n  filter = 'top',\r\n  extensions = 'Buttons',\r\n  fillContainer = FALSE,\r\n  rownames= FALSE,\r\n  options = list(\r\n    pageLength = 5, \r\n    autoWidth = TRUE,\r\n    dom = 'Bfrtip',\r\n    buttons = c('copy'), \r\n    scrollX = TRUE, \r\n    selection=\"multiple\"\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModeling\r\nWe can now fit the model to the data and test what it tells us about the impact of the pandemic on people’s search interest in people analytics. We will use the brms r package for this, which allows us to make inferences about the model parameters within a Bayesian inferential framework. For this reason, we must also specify some additional parameters (e.g. chains, iter or warmup) of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that generates posterior samples of our model’s parameters.\r\nThe Bayesian framework also allows us to specify priors for the estimated parameters and use them to incorporate our domain knowledge into the analysis. The specified priors are important for both parameter estimation and hypothesis testing because they define our initial information state before we consider our data. Here, we will use relatively broad, uninformative, and only slightly regularizing priors (that is, the inference results will be very close to the results of standard, frequentist parameter estimation/hypothesis testing).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for Bayesian statistical inference\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\r\n\r\n# checking available priors for the models \r\nbrms::get_prior(\r\n  interestInPeopleAnalytics | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = mydata,\r\n  family = gaussian())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# specifying wide, uninformative, and only mildly regularizing priors \r\npriors <- c(brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"elapsedTime\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"elapsedTimeAfterPandemic\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthApr\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthAug\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthDec\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthFeb\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthJul\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthJun\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthMar\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthMay\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthNov\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthOct\"),\r\n            brms::set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthSep\"))\r\n\r\n# defining the statistical model\r\nmodel <- brms::brm(\r\n  interestInPeopleAnalytics | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = mydata,\r\n  family = gaussian(),\r\n  prior = priors,\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  iter = 20000,\r\n  warmup = 2000,\r\n  seed = 1234,\r\n  sample_prior = TRUE, \r\n  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.9),\r\n  backend = \"cmdstanr\",\r\n  refresh = 0,\r\n  silent = 2 \r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore making any inferences, we should perform several validation checks to ensure that the mechanics of the MCMC algorithm worked well and that we can use the generated posterior samples to make inferences about the parameters of our model. There are many ways to do this, but here we will only use a visual check of the MCMC chains. We want the plots of these chains to look like a hairy caterpillar, indicating the convergence of the underlying Markov chain to stationarity and the convergence of the Monte Carlo estimates to population quantities, respectively. As can be seen in the graph below, we can observe the characteristics we are looking for in the MCMC chains described above.

We can see that it is on the right-hand side of the zero value, which supports the claim that there is an effect of the pandemic on people’s interest in people analytics immediately after the pandemic outbreak; however, it is on the opposite side of the zero value than we would expect if the pandemic were to have a positive effect on people’s interest in people analytics. Thus, this suggests that immediately after the pandemic outbreak, interest in people analysis declined slightly (somewhere between ~1 and ~20 points, as indicated by the 95% credible interval).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for working with output from Bayesian models\r\nlibrary(tidybayes)\r\n\r\nparamVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak <- model %>%\r\n  tidybayes::gather_draws(b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(value = .value)\r\n\r\ndens <- density(paramVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak$value)\r\n\r\nparamVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak <- tibble::tibble(x = dens$x, y = dens$y)\r\n\r\n# visualizing the posterior distribution of the model's b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter \r\nggplot2::ggplot(paramVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak, aes(x,y)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_area(data = filter(paramVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak, x > 0), fill = \"#fca636\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_area(data = filter(paramVizBeforethepandemicoutbreak, x <= 0), fill = \"grey\") +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Posterior distribution of the pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter\",\r\n    y = \"Density\",\r\n    x = \"pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\"\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggthemes::theme_clean()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for working with output from Bayesian models\r\nlibrary(posterior)\r\n\r\n# extracting posterior samples\r\nsamplesBeforethepandemicoutbreak <- posterior::as_draws_df(model, seed = 1234)\r\n\r\n# probability of b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak coefficient being higher than 0\r\nsum(samplesBeforethepandemicoutbreak$b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak > 0) / nrow(samplesBeforethepandemicoutbreak)\r\n\r\n[1] 0.9902778\r\n\r\nNow let’s check the second key parameter of our model, the time after the pandemic term. In this case, the posterior distribution is again on the right-hand side of zero value, but now this result is consistent with the claim that there is a positive effect of the pandemic on people’s interest in people analytics, specifically in terms of the change in slope after the pandemic. Compared to the pre-pandemic trend, the post-pandemic trend is steeper by ~0 to ~1 point per month (as indicated by the 95% confidence interval). We should bear in mind, however, that this effect may in fact only be an artifact caused by the improved data collection system from January 2022, as mentioned at the very beginning of this post.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nparamVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic <- model %>%\r\n  tidybayes::gather_draws(b_elapsedTimeAfterPandemic) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(value = .value)\r\n\r\ndens <- density(paramVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic$value)\r\n\r\nparamVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic <- tibble::tibble(x = dens$x, y = dens$y)\r\n\r\n# visualizing the posterior distribution of the model's b_elapsedTimeAfterPandemic parameter \r\nggplot2::ggplot(paramVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic, aes(x,y)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_area(data = filter(paramVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic, x > 0), fill = \"#fca636\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_area(data = filter(paramVizElapsedTimeAfterPandemic, x <= 0), fill = \"grey\") +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Posterior distribution of the elapsedTimeAfterPandemic parameter\",\r\n    y = \"Density\",\r\n    x = \"elapsedTimeAfterPandemic\"\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggthemes::theme_clean()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# extracting posterior samples\r\nsamplesElapsedTimeAfterPandemic <- posterior::as_draws_df(model, seed = 1234)\r\n\r\n# probability of b_elapsedTimeAfterPandemic coefficient being higher than 0\r\nsum(samplesElapsedTimeAfterPandemic$b_elapsedTimeAfterPandemic > 0) / nrow(samplesElapsedTimeAfterPandemic)\r\n\r\n[1] 0.9897361\r\n\r\nThe overall resulting picture thus partially supports the impression of many of my people analytics fellows about the growing importance of people analytics in HR and business leaders’ decision making. However, given that the Google search interest in people analytics is a fairly distant proxy for its actual use in HR and business practice, we should take these results with a grain of salt and try to find other data sources that would support our results. For example, Frank Corrigan, head of analytics at Ponder, came up with the idea of analyzing changes in postings for people analytics job positions over time. A good inspiration for anyone willing to spend some time getting at and analyzing such data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The chosen task was to analyze the effectiveness of\r\nrecruiting sources for a company that plans to double in size\r\nfrom its current 750+ employees.\r\nAlthough the dummy data provided was quite limited for obvious\r\nreasons and did not allow to answer all relevant questions (but you\r\ncould also use your own data which would not suffer from this\r\nshortcoming), after combining them and enriching them slightly based on\r\nrealistic assumptions, it was possible to arrive at quite interesting\r\ninsights and recommendations. See for yourself - the resulting\r\npresentation is attached to this post below.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

Not only is it a valid alternative\r\nto standard statistical inference, but as a by-product it helps with\r\nbuilding intuition about the\r\ndifference between signal and noise.\r\nThe basis of the method is a so-called lineup\r\nprotocol that places a graph of the actual data between arrays\r\nof graphs of null data that are generated by a method consistent with\r\nthe null hypothesis. The lineup is shown to one or more observers who\r\nare asked to identify the graph that differs. If an observer can pick\r\nout the actual data as different from the others, this gives weight to\r\nthe statistical significance of the pattern in the graph.\r\nBecause people usually have a hard time recognizing randomness and\r\ntend to see patterns even where there are none, there is also a\r\nso-called Rorschach protocol that only displays graphs\r\ncreated with null datasets and which is used by observers to calibrate\r\ntheir eyes for variation due to sampling.\r\nYou can try it for yourself in the graphs below, which show the\r\nrelationship between two variables from my current area of work\r\n(collaboration\r\nanalytics), namely between time\r\navailable for focused work and the use of timeboxing\r\n(productivity enhancing technique of assigning a fixed unit of time to\r\nan activity within which a planned activity takes place).\r\nUse the first array of graphs (the Rorschach protocol) to calibrate\r\nyour eye for randomness and then try to identify the actual data in the\r\nsecond array of graphs (the lineup protocol).

The actual data are shown in chart #\r\n12. As you can see in the chart below, the relationship between time for\r\nfocused work and the use of timeboxing is slightly negative, which makes\r\npretty good sense, because people who have enough time for focused work\r\nusually don’t have such a strong need to block out time for focused work\r\nin their calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmydata %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = focusRate, y = propBlockedTime)) +\r\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +\r\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(NA,NA), labels = scales::number_format(suffix = \"%\")) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels =  scales::percent_format()) +\r\n  labs(\r\n    x = \"FOCUS RATE\",\r\n    y = \"PROPORTION OF BLOCKED WORKING TIME\",\r\n    title = \"RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOCUSED TIME AND TIMEBOXING USAGE\",\r\n    caption = \"\\nThe blue line in the graph represents the linear regression line.\"\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can also test the relationship between time for focused work and\r\nthe use of timeboxing more formally by fitting a Bayesian\r\nbeta regression model to the data. As you can see in the summary\r\ntables and charts below, the null value is safely outside the 95%\r\ncredible interval of the mean of the focus rate parameter, and the\r\nmarginal effect of focus rate clearly shows its negative relationship\r\nwith the predicted proportion of working time blocked in the calendar.\r\nNote also that the relationship is non-linear, i.e. the marginal effect\r\nof the focus rate is different depending on its level.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading libraries\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\nlibrary(bayesplot)\r\nlibrary(tidybayes) \r\nlibrary(ggdist)       \r\n\r\n# fitting Bayesian beta regression model\r\nmodel <- brms::brm(\r\n  bf(\r\n    propBlockedTime ~ focusRate,\r\n    phi ~ focusRate\r\n    ),\r\n  data=mydata,\r\n  family= Beta(),\r\n  seed = 1234,\r\n  iter = 20000,\r\n  warmup = 2000,\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  cores = 6,\r\n  control = list(\r\n    adapt_delta = 0.9,\r\n    max_treedepth = 20\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# summary of the fitted model\r\nsummary(model)\r\n\r\n\r\n Family: beta \r\n  Links: mu = logit; phi = log \r\nFormula: propBlockedTime ~ focusRate \r\n         phi ~ focusRate\r\n   Data: mydata (Number of observations: 306) \r\n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 20000; warmup = 2000; thin = 1;\r\n         total post-warmup draws = 72000\r\n\r\nPopulation-Level Effects: \r\n              Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS\r\nIntercept        -0.85      0.25    -1.33    -0.35 1.00    61653\r\nphi_Intercept     2.09      0.39     1.30     2.84 1.00    59323\r\nfocusRate        -0.02      0.00    -0.03    -0.02 1.00    57209\r\nphi_focusRate     0.01      0.01    -0.01     0.02 1.00    56423\r\n              Tail_ESS\r\nIntercept        54084\r\nphi_Intercept    51459\r\nfocusRate        55167\r\nphi_focusRate    51573\r\n\r\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

As you can see, there is little difference between the two groups in terms of the average daily amount of time people spend by collaboration over the last six months (see the density plots), but there is a fairly clear difference in the trend of this metric over the same period, suggesting that less satisfied employees may be suffering from increasing collaboration overload (see the line charts with trend lines for individual employees and the estimated overall linear trend).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have a similar experience with or just a strong hunch about other metrics in your area of expertise?

As in other activities, even here the well-known Parkinson’s rule applies that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” When this is combined with the automatic use of default meeting lengths, it leads to spending more time in meetings than is necessary.\r\nFor this reason, Steven Rogelberg suggests in his book The Surprising Science of Meetings that all meeting times should be reduced by 5-10 percent by default.\r\nTo assess whether you have room for improvement in this regard, it is useful to compare actual and planned meeting lengths. For illustration, the attached chart shows the distribution of the typical differences between actual and planned meeting lengths for each of our teams organizing online meetings over the course of a year. It clearly shows that a large proportion of teams are organizing meetings longer than necessary, by an average of 4 minutes.

However, the resulting cultural diversity can bring not only positive effects (e.g. a broader set of perspectives, a more diverse skill base, local market knowledge and insight, better creativity and innovation, etc.) but also some challenges (e.g. risk of prejudice or negative cultural stereotypes, misinterpretation of communication, conflicting work styles, different understanding of professional etiquette, etc.).\r\nBetter knowledge and awareness of the cultural specificities of the societies from which people come is one way of dealing with these challenges. In this respect, Hofstede’s theory of cultural dimensions may be useful to us. Just as Big-5 theory facilitates our understanding of other people’s personalities, Hofstede’s theory facilitates our understanding of their cultural background by describing their social values and releated behaviors through the following six cultural dimensions:\r\n\r\nImage source: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/hofstedes-cultural-dimensions-theory/\r\nYou can easily check how countries are doing on these six dimensions on the Hofstede Insights website. To make it easier to compare cultural differences/similarities between countries, I built a simple app that projects the cultural profiles of countries into 2D space using dimensionality reduction technique called UMAP (Uniform manifold approximation and projection). By selecting a specific cultural dimension, you can see how it is distributed across countries and continents. In addition, you can select some specific countries in the comparator and compare them across all six cultural dimensions.\r\nCheck it out here ➡️ https://peopleanalyticsblog.shinyapps.io/Hofstede_Cultural_Dimensions/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

[By]\r\ndefault you change what you’re doing every hour. But [makers] generally\r\nprefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or\r\nprogram well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get\r\nstarted. When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a\r\ndisaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it\r\ninto two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to\r\nremember to go to the meeting.\r\nI recently realized that I have only seen illustrative pictures on\r\nthis topic so far, but not any real data. This inspired me to look at\r\nour own collaboration data at Time\r\nIs Ltd. and see if these two schedule categories can be found\r\nthere.\r\nWhen I contrasted the data on the average number of meetings per day\r\nand the average time between meetings, there were indeed categories of\r\npeople who either have relatively more meetings with relatively shorter\r\nbreaks (managers), or have relatively fewer meetings with\r\nrelatively longer breaks (makers).\r\n\r\nBut beyond that, there was a third type, which I called\r\nbatchers - they have relatively fewer meetings with relatively\r\nshorter breaks, which is a good strategy when you have to be both\r\nmanager and creator, which may be the case for more and more people as\r\nwe move to remote working.\r\nIn the charts below you can see how typical monthly calendars of\r\nthese three types of schedulers look like.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we cannot see in our own data, but could theoretically be there,\r\nis a fourth category I call overtimers, who have relatively\r\nmore meetings but manage to keep relatively longer breaks in between.\r\nHowever, this can only be achieved by making the meetings more spread\r\nout over time, i.e. at the cost of working after hours.\r\nHow about you? Where would you fit in? And is there anyone among you\r\nwho would fit into the fourth, missing category?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To znamená, že pokud firmy chtějí přilákat a také si udržet talentované zaměstnance, musí být schopny zajistit, že se u nich s muži a ženami bude v tomto ohledu zacházet stejně. Prvním krokem k tomu je zjistit, jak velký je rozdíl mezi platy mužů a žen ve firmě a do jaké míry ho lze vysvětlit jinými faktory než je samotné pohlaví zaměstnance. V tomto článku demonstruji, jak takovou analýzu provést s pomocí analytického nástroje R a dat, která má většina firem běžně k dispozici. Stručně se zmiňuji rovněž o tom, jaké mohou být případné další kroky a doporučení vyplývající z výsledků provedné analýzy.",

Obvykle je GPG vyjadřována procenty, poměrem typické\r\nhrubé hodinové (či roční) mzdy ženy k typické mzdě muže nebo poměrem\r\nrozdílu mezi typickou mzdou mužů a žen vůči typické mzdě mužů.\r\nBez ohledu na způsob měření GPG, je dobře doloženým faktem, že ženy\r\njsou obecně hůře placeny než muži, jakkoli se tento rozdíl\r\npostupem času zmenšuje. Rozdíly v platech se přitom mohou v\r\njednotlivých zemích poměrně dost lišit. Názorně to ilustruje níže\r\nuvedený graf, který ukazuje vývoj (neadjustované) GPG (definované jako\r\npoměr rozdílu mediánové mzdy zaměstnaných mužů a žen a mediánové mzdy\r\nzaměstnaných mužů) v průběhu několika minulých let v zemích OECD.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\ngpgoecd <- readr::read_csv(\"./DP_LIVE_29012021212234147.csv\")\r\n\r\n# creating color palette\r\n# list of R color Brewer's palettes: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html\r\nnbCols <- length(unique(gpgoecd$LOCATION))\r\nmyColors <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(8, \"Set1\"))(nbCols)\r\n\r\n# creating a graph\r\ng <- gpgoecd %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(LOCATION, Value), y = Value, fill = LOCATION,\r\n                      text = paste('Země: ', LOCATION,\r\n                                 '<\/br><\/br>GPG: ', round(Value))))+\r\n  ggplot2::geom_col() +\r\n  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~ TIME, nrow = 4) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(x = \"\",\r\n                y = \"GPG\",\r\n                title = \"Genderová příjmová nerovnost v zemích OECD v letech 2016-2019\") +\r\n  ggthemes::theme_few() +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_manual(values = myColors) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"\",\r\n                 legend.title = element_blank(),\r\n                 axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\r\n\r\n\r\n# making the graph interactive\r\nplotly::ggplotly(\r\n  g, \r\n  width = 800,\r\n  height = 700,\r\n  tooltip = \"text\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDůvodů pro nevyváženost příjmů žen a mužů pravděpodobně existuje\r\nvětší množství. Mezi nejčastěji uváděné důvody patří:\r\nDiskriminace na pracovišti. Stejné práce je\r\nodměňována rozdílně čistě na základě pohlaví pracovníka.\r\nGenderové stereotypy. Předsudky ohledně výkonnosti,\r\nschopností a vlastností žen mají za následek oslabení jejich pozic a\r\nvytváření tzv. „skleněného stropu“, tj. neviditelné bariéry, na kterou\r\nženy naráží při snaze o kariérní postup na lépe placené pozice.\r\nSegregace trhu. Odvětví, v nichž je tradičně\r\nzaměstnáváno více žen než mužů jako je zdravotnictví, školství nebo\r\nveřejná správa, jsou společností vnímána jako méně prestižní, a tedy i\r\nhůře odměňována.\r\nRodinný život. Ženy většinou nesou větší část\r\nzátěže spojené s rodinným životem (např. při odchodu na mateřskou\r\ndovolenou, při péči o nemocné děti či jiné členy domácnosti), což jim\r\nvýznamně stěžuje jejich snahu o kariérní růst.\r\nV situaci, kdy při reportování GPG nerozlišujeme mezi různými důvody\r\npro platovou nerovnost, hovoříme o tzv. neadjustované\r\nGPG. Pro potřeby firemního auditu platové nerovnosti je však\r\ndůležité zjistit rovněž tzv. adjustovanou GPG, která se\r\nsnaží vyjádřit míru platové nerovnosti, která je způsobena čistě\r\npohlavím zaměstnance. Zatímco adjustovaná GPG umožňuje firmě\r\nidentifikovat možnou diskriminaci na pracovišti, neadjustovaná GPG (při\r\nneprokázané adjustované GPG) může poukazovat na existenci problémů jako\r\njsou genderové stereotypy či nedostatečná podpora žen při snaze skloubit\r\nsvůj osobní a profesní život. Pro firmy je tak užitečné sledovat oba\r\nukazatele.\r\nProč se\r\nzabývat platovou nerovností ve Vaší firmě?\r\nI kdybychom odhlédli od etických či právních aspektů platové\r\nnerovnosti mezi muži a ženami, je ve velice pragmatickém zájmu každé\r\nfirmy, aby se tento druh nespravedlnosti v jejím systému odměňování\r\nnevyskytoval. V době sociálních sítí a platforem na hodnocení firem\r\njejich současnými i bývalými zaměstnanci (za všechny zmiňme např. Glassdoor nebo\r\nčeský Atmoskop) se totiž\r\ninformace o nerovném přístupu může velice snadno rozšířit mezi\r\npotenciální i stávající zaměstnance, kteří ji mohou zohlednit při svém\r\nrozhodování, zda se v dané firmě ucházet o práci, resp. zda v ní i\r\nnadále zůstat.\r\nTuto skutečnost dokládají např. výsledky průzkumu\r\nprovedeného společností Glassdoor, podle kterého cca 67 % (U.S.)\r\nzaměstnanců by se neucházelo o práci tam, kde by si myslelo, že muži a\r\nženy mají nerovné platové podmínky.\r\nAudit platové\r\nnerovnosti mezi muži a ženami\r\nStejně jako při řešení jakéhokoli jiného problému, i v tomto případě\r\nplatí, že v první řadě je především potřeba ověřit, že nějaký\r\nproblém k řešení vůbec existuje. K tomu poslouží\r\nfiremní audit platové nerovnosti mezi muži a ženami.\r\nTen prostřednictvím analýzy platových, demografických a organizačních\r\ndat ověří, zda máme nějaké doklady pro to, že v dané společnosti\r\nexistují platové rozdíly mezi zaměstnanci spojené s jejich pohlavím.\r\nTeprve na základě výsledků takové analýzy je možné se začít poohlížet po\r\nmožných opatřeních v oblastech náboru, odměňování a/nebo povyšování,\r\nkterá by mohla pomoct nespravedlivé platové nerovnosti odstranit nebo\r\nalespoň zmírnit.\r\nNíže uvedený příklad takového auditu vychází z článku How\r\nto Analyze Your Gender Pay Gap: An Employer’s Guide od Andrew\r\nChamberlaina, Ph.D., hlavního ekonoma a vedoucího výzkumu ve\r\nspolečnosti Glassdoor.\r\nPlán analýzy\r\nAnalýzu platové nerovnosti mezi muži a ženami provedeme v\r\nnásledujících několika krocích:\r\nNačteme si data, která obsahují informace o platech vzorku\r\nzaměstnanců, jejich pohlaví, demografických a organizačních\r\ncharakteristikách, na kterých budeme testovat naše hypotézy.

Rychlý přehled o\r\nněkterých těchto vztazích nám může poskytnout níže uvedený graf, který\r\nzobrazuje souvislosti mezi jednotlivými dvojicemi proměnných a s pomocí\r\nbarevného kódování navíc nese informaci o tom, jak se tyto souvislosti\r\nliší mezi pohlavími. V grafu můžeme např. vidět, že se v případě\r\nněkterých pracovních pozic významně liší relativní zastoupení mužů a\r\nžen. V menší míře se zdá tento rozdíl platit i v případě úrovně\r\nvzdělání. Určitý rozdíl mezi muži a ženami se zdá existovat rovněž ve\r\nvýši jejich základní mzdy (narozdíl od bonusové složky, která se zdá být\r\nu mužů a žen obdobně vysoká).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nGGally::ggpairs(mydata, aes(color = gender, alpha = 0.4)) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(\r\n      strip.text.x = element_text(\r\n        size = 22),\r\n      strip.text.y = element_text(\r\n        size = 22)\r\n      ) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2:: scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVizuální dojem o rozdílné výši základní mzdy u mužů a žen potvrzuje i\r\ndetailnější analýza tohoto rozdílu. Ta ukazuje, že v našem vzorku\r\nmediánová mzda žen činí 89913.5 USD a mediánová mzda mužů 98223 USD. To\r\nodpovídá rozdílu 8309.5 USD, resp. neadjustované GPG (definované jako\r\npoměr rozdílu mediánové mzdy mužů a žen a mediánové mzdy mužů) 8.5 %.\r\nMíra platové nerovnosti se tak v námi sledované firmě zdá být spíše\r\nnižší, srovnatelná s celkovou hodnotou tohoto ukazatele v zemích jako je\r\nnapř. Švédsko nebo Nový Zéland (viz graf z úvodu tohoto článku).\r\nPokud bychom chtěli zohlednit míru naší nejistoty při odhadu\r\nvelikosti rozdílu mezi typickým platem mužů a žen, která je daná tím, že\r\npracujeme pouze se vzorkem zaměstnanců a nikoli s celou firmou, měli\r\nbychom sáhnout po inferenční statistice. Při použití bayesovského\r\nekvivalentu t-testu pro dva nezávislé výběry získáme takto informaci o\r\nposteriorní distribuci velikosti tohoto rozdílu. Na grafu níže můžeme\r\nvidět, že 95% interval kredibility se nachází v rozmezí od 5511 do 11615\r\nUSD, s mediánovou hodnotou 8392 USD. Z grafu také můžeme vyčíst, že\r\ndostupná data mluví silně v neprospěch nulové hypotézy o neexistenci\r\nrozdílu mezi průměrným platem mužů a žen - viz velmi nízká hodnota\r\nlogaritmu Bayesova\r\nfaktoru ve prospěch nulové hypotézu BF01.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nset.seed(123)\r\nggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(\r\n  data = mydata,\r\n  x = gender,\r\n  y = basePay,\r\n  type = \"bayes\",\r\n  title = \"Rozdíl v základní mzdě mezi muži a ženami\",\r\n  palette = \"Dark2\"\r\n) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(\r\n    labels = scales::number_format(\r\n      accuracy = 1,\r\n      scale = 1/1000,\r\n      suffix = \"k\",\r\n      prefix = \"$\",\r\n      big.mark = \",\"),\r\n    limits = c(0,200000)\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(x = \"\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamotný fakt rozdílné výše základní mzdy u mužů a žen ale\r\nještě nemusí automaticky znamenat, že by se za ním skrývala diskriminace\r\nžen. Pozorovaný rozdíl může být totiž např. způsobený tím, že\r\nženy zaměstnané v námi sledované firmě mají typicky nižší vzdělání než\r\nve stejné firmě zaměstnaní muži. A vzhledem k tomu, že výše vzdělání (z\r\nhlediska “meritokratické spravedlnosti” zcela neproblematicky) pozitivně\r\nkoreluje s výší platu, projeví se tato souvislost v nižší typické mzdě\r\nžen (ponechme nyní stranou otázku, v jaké míře mají ženy obecně přístup\r\nk vyššímu vzdělání ve společnosti, kde daná firma působí). Tuto hypotézu\r\nse zdají podporovat i dva níže uvedené grafy, které vizualizují vztah\r\nmezi úrovní vzdělání zaměstnance a výší jeho základní mzdy, resp.\r\nsouvislost mezi pohlavím zaměstnance a úrovní jeho vzdělání.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmydata %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = edu, y = basePay)) +\r\n  PupillometryR::geom_flat_violin(position = position_nudge(x = .2, y = 0), alpha = .8, fill = \"#a9b2d1\") +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point(aes(y = basePay), position = position_jitter(width = .15), size = .5, alpha = 0.8, color = \"#a9b2d1\") +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_boxplot(width = .1, guides = FALSE, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.5, fill = \"#a9b2d1\") +\r\n  ggplot2::expand_limits(x = 5.25) +\r\n  ggplot2::guides(fill = FALSE) +\r\n  ggplot2::guides(color = FALSE) +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(\r\n    labels = scales::number_format(\r\n      accuracy = 1,\r\n      scale = 1/1000,\r\n      suffix = \"k\",\r\n      prefix = \"$\",\r\n      ),\r\n    limits = c(0,200000)\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(title = \"Vztah mezi úrovní vzdělání a výší základní mzdy\",\r\n       x = \"\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmydata %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = edu, fill = gender)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_hue() +\r\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(title = \"Míra zastoupení můžů a žen v jednotlivých kategoriích úrovně vzdělání\",\r\n                x = \"\",\r\n                y = \"\",\r\n                fill = \"\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2:: scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"top\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPodobných kombinovaných souvislostí může v našich datech (a v\r\nrealitě, kterou reprezentují) existovat větší množství. Pokud by čtenář\r\nchtěl vztahy mezi různými kombinacemi proměnných prozkoumat sám a\r\ndetailněji, může za tímto účelem využít tuto\r\ninteraktivní aplikaci, kde jsou nahraná naše data a kde lze snadno\r\nrůzným způsobem vizualizovat zadané kombinace proměnných. Viz níže\r\nuvedená ukázka využití této aplikace při vizualizaci vztahu mezi výší\r\nplatu, pohlavím a pracovní pozicí, včetně počtu zaměstnanců v\r\njednotlivých kombinovaných kategoriích. Z tohoto konkrétního grafu je\r\ndobře patrné, že ženy jsou ve srovnání s muži disproporčně méně\r\nzastoupeny na dvou nadprůměrně odměňovaných pozicích Manager a\r\nSoftware Engineer a naopak disproporčně více jsou zastoupeny na\r\npodprůměrně platově ohodnocené pozici Marketing Associate.\r\n\r\n Důležitou kategorií vztahů mezi proměnnými, kterou bychom měli\r\nprozkoumat, pokud se chceme co nejblíže dostat k příčinám pozorovaných\r\nnerovností v platech mužů a žen a dobře zacílit případné intervence,\r\njsou tzv. interakce. Ty popisují situace, kdy vztah\r\nmezi dvěma proměnnými závisí na hodnotě nějaké třetí proměnné. Nás zde\r\nbude konkrétně zajímat interakce mezi naší hlavní nezávislou proměnnou\r\n(prediktorem), tj. pohlavím zaměstnance, a dalšími nezávislými\r\nproměnnými (např. věkem, úrovní vzdělání, hodnocením pracovního výkonu,\r\npracovní pozicí nebo oddělením) ve vztahu k naší závislé proměnné\r\n(kritériu), tedy základní mzdě.\r\nPříkladem vizualizace tohoto druhu vztahu mezi proměnnými je níže\r\nuvedený graf, ze kterého můžeme vyčíst, že ženy mají sice v průměru\r\nnižší základní mzdu než muži napříč celým věkovým spektrem (viz níže\r\npoložená regresní přímka pro skupinu žen), ale fakt, že zobrazené\r\nregresní přímky jsou rovnoběžné, svědčí pro to, že v rámci obou skupin\r\nplatí stejný typ vztahu mezi věkem a výší platu, a tedy že mezi pohlavím\r\na věkem ve vztahu k výši mzdy nedochází k žádné interakci. Pokud by se\r\nexistence takové interakce potvrdila i při zohlednění dalších\r\nrelevantních faktorů, mělo by to pro nás být podnětem k další exploraci\r\ntoho, co se pozorovaným rozdílem skrývá.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmydata %>%\r\n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = age, y = basePay, fill = gender, colour = gender, group = gender)) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_point(size = 1L, position = \"jitter\", alpha = 0.5) +\r\n  ggplot2::geom_smooth(span = 1L, method = \"lm\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\r\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(title = \"Vztah mezi věkem zaměstnanců a výší jejich základní mzdy\",\r\n                fill = \"\",\r\n                color = \"\") +\r\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(\r\n    labels = scales::number_format(\r\n      accuracy = 1,\r\n      scale = 1/1000,\r\n      suffix = \"k\",\r\n      prefix = \"$\",\r\n      big.mark = \",\"),\r\n    limits = c(0,200000)\r\n    ) +\r\n  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"top\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatistický model platové\r\nnerovnosti\r\nAbychom dokázali izolovat vliv samotného pohlaví zaměstnanců na výši\r\nplatu a zohlednit přitom zároveň vliv všech ostatních relevantních\r\nfaktorů, včetně některých jejich interakcí, musíme sáhnout po\r\nkomplexnějším nástroji než je popisná statistika. A tímto nástrojem je\r\nstatistické modelování.\r\nStatistické modelování, podobně jako jakékoli jiné modelování ve\r\nvědě, ale i v běžném životě, není ničím jiným než snahou\r\nvytvořit menší a zjednodušený model našeho světa, který však\r\njeho chování odráží dostatečně věrně na to, abychom s jeho pomocí mohli\r\nčinit úsudky a předpovědi o skutečném světě a zakládat na něm svá\r\nrozhodnutí (k tomuto tématu viz srozumitelně napsaný\r\npopularizující článek Modeluji,\r\ntedy jsem od Josefa Šlerky).\r\nStatistické modelování se potom od jiných druhů modelování liší v tom,\r\nže se ve větší míře opírá o nástroje matematické statistiky a teorie\r\npravděpodobnosti.\r\nPřekvapivě mnoho jevů našeho světa se dá úspěšně modelovat a\r\npředpovídat pomocí relativně jednoduchých statistických modelů\r\nzobecněné lineární regrese (Generalized Linear\r\nModels, GLM). Ty předpokládají, že závislá proměnná, transformovaná\r\nprostřednictvím tzv. linkovací funkce (link\r\nfunction), je funkcí lineární kombinace nezávislých proměnných.\r\nNejznámější z této rodiny statistických modelů je klasický\r\nlineární model, který předpokládá normální rozdělení závislé\r\nproměnné, resp. reziduí (chyb) okolo predikované/ očekávané střední\r\nhodnoty závislé proměnné (viz ilustrativní obrázek níže).\r\n\r\nVzhledem k tomu, že námi modelovaná proměnná základní mzdy se zdá mít\r\nnormální, nebo téměř normální rozdělení (viz některé grafy v části\r\nvěnované explorační analýze), můžeme i my sáhnout po tomto statistickém\r\nmodelu. Jako nezávislé proměnné v našem modelu použijeme všechny nám\r\ndostupné prediktory, spolu s interakcemi mezi proměnnou pohlaví na\r\nstraně jedné a proměnnými úrovně vzdělání, seniority, věku a hodnocení\r\npracovního výkonu na straně druhé. Protože zaměstnanci tvoří přirozené\r\nshluky v rámci oddělení, napříč kterými se liší výše mzdy a také by se\r\nmohla lišit povaha vztahu mezi pohlavím zaměstnance a výší jeho mzdy,\r\npoužijeme hierarchickou/víceúrovňovou variantu modelu lineární\r\nregrese, která umožňuje, aby hodnoty vybraných parametrů modelu\r\nvariovaly v závilosti na příslušnosti zaměstnanců do konkrétního\r\noddělení.\r\nK odhadu hodnot parametrů našeho modelu použijeme inferenční\r\nrámec bayesovské statistiky, která ve srovnání s\r\nfrekventistickou statistikou nabízí bohatší a intuitivně snáze\r\nuchopitelné výstupy. Pro apriorní distribuci parametrů modelu použijeme\r\ndefaultní, široké a neinformativní hodnoty, takže výsledky analýzy budou\r\nnominálně podobné těm, které bychom získali při použití tradičnější\r\nfrekventistické inferenční statistiky.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# defining and running the model\r\n\r\nmodel <- brms::brm(\r\n  basePay | trunc(lb = 0) \r\n  ~ 1 \r\n  + jobTitle \r\n  + gender \r\n  + age \r\n  + perfEval \r\n  + edu \r\n  + seniority \r\n  + gender:edu \r\n  + gender:seniority \r\n  + gender:age \r\n  + gender:perfEval \r\n  + (1 + gender | dept),  \r\n  data = mydata %>% dplyr::mutate_if(is.factor, as.character),\r\n  family = gaussian(link = \"identity\"),\r\n  iter = 3000,\r\n  chains = 3,\r\n  cores = 6,\r\n  warmup = 1000,\r\n  seed = 2809,\r\n  control = list(\r\n    adapt_delta = 0.99, \r\n    max_treedepth = 20\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVýsledky analýzy\r\nDříve než přistoupíme k interpretaci výsledků analýzy je dobré si\r\nověřit, že náš statistický model dokáže dostatečně věrně napodobit či\r\nsimulovat data reprezentující firemní realitu, na jejíž vlastnosti\r\nchceme s pomocí tohoto modelu usuzovat. Za tímto účelem můžeme použít\r\nnástroj posteriorní prediktivní kontroly (posterior predictive\r\ncheck), který ověřuje, jak moc dobře námi zvolený a odhadnutý model\r\npredikuje pozorovaná data na základě vzorku posteriorních hodnot jeho\r\nparametrů. Z níže uvedeného grafu je dobře patrné, že náš model si z\r\ntohoto hlediska nevede vůbec špatně.\r\nPo této kontrole (a také po ověření dalších technických\r\nnáležitostí, jako je např. konvergence MCMC\r\nřetězců, které umožňují odhadnout posteriorneí distribuci parametrů i\r\nkomplexnějších statistických modelů jako je ten náš) můžeme začít\r\nvyužívat parametry našeho modelu k usuzování na pravděpodobné vlastnosti\r\nnámi studované firemní reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# investigating the model's fit\r\n\r\n# specifying the number of samples\r\nnsamples = 100\r\n\r\nbrms::pp_check(\r\n  model, \r\n  nsamples = nsamples\r\n  ) + \r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = stringr::str_glue(\"Posteriorní prediktivní kontrola modelu za použití vzorku o velikoti n = {nsamples}\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNíže je uveden souhrn informací o našem odhadnutém modelu. Primárně\r\nnás zajímá hodnota parametru pohlaví (genderMale) v sekci\r\nvěnované efektům na úrovni celé populace (Population-Level\r\nEffects). 95% interval kredibility (Credible Interval),\r\nkterý udává kam v posteriorním rozdělení spadá hodnota nepozorovaného\r\nparametru s 95% pravděpodobností, se nachází v rozmezí od -3750.04 USD\r\ndo 9081.92 USD, se střední hodnotou 2717.57. Tzn., že podle našeho\r\nmodelu má muž - při zohlednění ostatních faktorů a jejich vybraných\r\ninterakcí - typicky o cca 2700 USD vyšší základní mzdu než její ženský\r\nprotějšek. Analýza našich dat tak do určité míry podporuje hypotézu o\r\nexistenci platové diskriminace na základě pohlaví zaměstnance v námi\r\nstudované firmě. Síla důkazu ve prospěch této hypotézy však není nijak\r\nvýrazná, což vyplývá z toho, že 95% interval kredibility zahrnuje vedle\r\nkladných hodnot i nulovou hodnotu a záporné hodnoty parametru pohlaví\r\njako jeho plauzibilní hodnoty.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nsummary(model)\r\n\r\n\r\n Family: gaussian \r\n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \r\nFormula: basePay | trunc(lb = 0) ~ 1

Za tímto účelem můžeme použít vizualizaci marginálních efektů\r\njednotlivých prediktorů, které vyjadřují vztah mezi prediktorem a\r\nkritériem při zohlednění vlivu ostatních prediktorů. Takto např. můžeme\r\nna jednom z grafů vidět, že vztah mezi úrovní vzdělání a výší základního\r\nplatu se má tendenci u mužů a žen lišit. Na jiném grafu si můžeme zase\r\nvšimnout toho, že rozdíl mezi základní mzdou mužů a žen má tendenci\r\nnarůstat s tím, jak klesá seniorita zaměstnanců. Tyto a další podobné\r\nvhledy nám mohou pomoct přiblížit se k důvodům za pozorovanými\r\nnerovnostmi v platech mužů a žen.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# plotting marginal effects of predictors used \r\n# Note: Conditional vs. Marginal Relationships: The regression coefficients in generalized linear mixed models represent conditional effects in the sense that they express comparisons holding the cluster-specific random effects (and covariates) constant. For this reason, conditional effects are sometimes referred to as cluster-specific effects. In contrast, marginal effects can be obtained by averaging the conditional expectation μij over the random effects distribution. Marginal effects express comparisons of entire sub-population strata defined by covariate values and are sometimes referred to as population-averaged effects.In linear mixed models (identity link), the regression coefficents can be interpreted as either conditional or marginal effects. However, conditional and marginal effects differ for most other link functions.\r\n\r\nmarginalEffplots <- plot(\r\n  brms::marginal_effects(\r\n    model, \r\n    effects = c(\"jobTitle\", \"age\", \"perfEval\", \"edu\", \"seniority\", \"gender:edu\", \"gender:seniority\", \"gender:age\", \"gender:perfEval\"),\r\n    probs = c(0.025, 0.975)),\r\n  ask = FALSE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# putting all graphs with marginal effects together  \r\nggpubr::ggarrange(\r\n  plotlist = marginalEffplots, \r\n  nrow = 9,\r\n  ncol = 1\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMožné další kroky\r\nI v situaci, kdy analýza dat nepodpoří naše podezření na existenci\r\nplatové diskriminace na základě pohlaví zaměstnance, je stále možné, že\r\nza pozorovaným rozdílem v platech mužů a žen jsou jiné faktory, které s\r\npohlavím zaměstance nějak souvisí. Např. skutečnost, že jsou ženy méně\r\nreprezentované na lépe placených seniornějších pozicích, by mohla\r\nsvědčit o tom, že se ženy na pracovišti mohou potýkat s genderovými\r\nstereotypy a že při snaze o kariérní postup na lépe placené pozice\r\nnarážejí na tzv. “skleněný strop“. Pro učinění takového závěru je však\r\nzapotřebí získat další data, a to spíše kvalitativní povahy, taková,\r\nkterá sbírá a analyzuje např. organizační\r\nči firemní\r\nantropologie.\r\nV situaci, kdy máme dostatečně silné důkazy pro to, že se za\r\npozorovanou platovou nerovností mezi muži a ženami skrývají faktory\r\nsouvisející s pohlavím zaměstnance, je možné začít se poohlížet po\r\nmožných řešeních. Stejně jako při identifikaci problému, i při hledání\r\nzpůsobu jeho řešení je dobré držet se zásad na\r\ndůkazech založeného managementu a volit pouze řešení s dostatečně\r\nempiricky doloženou účinností, která zároveň dávají smysl ve specifickém\r\nkontextu dané firmy.\r\nUžitečný přehled možných akcí, které zaměstnavatelé mohou podniknout\r\ns cílem snížit GPG ve své organizaci, vytvořila známá skupina odborníků\r\nna behaviorální vědy v rámci tzv. The\r\nBehavioral Insights Team, která svého času vznikla pro to, aby\r\nbritské vládě pomáhala realizovat účinnou politiku založenou na\r\ndůkazech. V dokumentu s názvem Reducing the gender pay gap and\r\nimproving gender equality in organisations: Evidence-based actions for\r\nemployers tato skupina odborníků uvádí několik možných intervencí,\r\nkteré řadí do tří kategorií podle toho, jak dobře je jejich účinnost\r\npodložená empirickými důkazy.\r\nMezi akce s dobře doloženou účinností řadí\r\nnásledující intervence:\r\nZahrnutí většího počtu žen do užších seznamů v rámci výběru nových\r\nzaměstnanců a povyšování.\r\nPoužívání úloh posuzujících úroveň pracovních dovedností v rámci\r\nvýběru nových zaměstnanců.\r\nPoužívání strukturovaného interview v rámci výběru nových\r\nzaměstnanců a povyšování.\r\nPodpora vyjednávání o výši platu pomocí zvěřejnění existujícího\r\nplatového rozmezí.\r\nZavedení transparentních procesů povyšování a odměňování.\r\nJmenování manažera či zřízení pracovní skupiny pro firemní\r\ndiverzitu.\r\nMezi potenciálně slibné akce, které ale vyžadují další důkazy\r\no své účinnosti, řadí následující postupy:\r\nZvýšení pracovní flexibility pro muže a pro ženy.\r\nPodporu sdílené rodičovské dovolené.\r\nNábor bývalých zaměstnanců, kteří museli z různých osobních důvodů\r\nna delší dobu přerušit svou kariéru.\r\nNabídku mentoringu and sponsorshipu.\r\nNabídku networkingových programů.\r\nNastavení interních cílů.\r\nA mezi akce se smíšenými doklady o jejich účinnosti\r\npotom řadí následující opatření:\r\nŠkolení věnované tématu nevědomých předsudků.\r\nŠkolení v oblasti diverzity.\r\nŠkolení věnované rozvoji leadershipu.\r\nDemograficky různorodé výběrové panely v rámci externího i interního\r\nnáboru.\r\nZde je pro zájemce originální dokument k bližšímu prostudování.\r\n\r\n\r\nTento prohlížeč nepodporuje soubory PDF.

One way they can help us is by verifying that we have really achieved our stated goals and that we are not just fooling ourselves into believing so. We need to keep in mind Richard Feynman’s famous principle of critical thinking…\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the tools that can help us with that is segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series data (thanks to Masatake Hirono for pointing me to its existence). It allows us to model changes in various processes and outcomes that follow interventions, while controlling for other types of changes (e.g. trends and seasonality) that may have occurred regardless of the interventions. It is thus very useful for data analysis conducted within studies with a quasi experimental study design that are often in the organizational context the best alternative to the “gold standard” of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are not always realizable or politically acceptable.\r\nSearch interest in work-life balance and well-being\r\nFor illustration, let’s use this tool for testing hypothesis about people’s increased interest in topics related to work-life balance and well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent changes in the way people work. As a proxy measure of this interest we will use worldwide search interest data over the last 10 years from Google Trends using search terms work-life balance and well-being (see Fig. 1 and 2 below).\r\nFig. 1: Interest in “work-life balance” topic over the last 10 years measured as a search interest by Google Trends. The numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means that there was not enough data for this term.\r\n\r\nFig. 2: Interest in “well-being” topic over the last 10 years measured as a search interest by Google Trends. The numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means that there was not enough data for this term.\r\n\r\nBased solely on the visual inspection of the graphs, it is pretty difficult to tell whether there was some effect of the COVID-19 pandemic or not, especially in the case of work-life balance (for the purpose of this analysis, the beginning of the pandemic is assumed to have started in March 2020). For sure it’s not a job for “inter-ocular trauma test” when the existence of the effect hits you directly between the eyes. We need to rely here on inferential statistics and its ability to help us with distinguishing signal from noise.\r\nBefore conducting the analysis itself, we need to wrangle the data from Google Trends a little bit using the recipe presented in the Wagner, Zhang, and Ross-Degnan’s paper. Specifically, we need the following five variables (or six, given that we have two dependent variables):\r\nsearch interest – numerical variable representing search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time; this variable is truncated within the interval between values of 0 and 100; a value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term; a value of 50 means that the term is half as popular; a score of 0 means that there was not enough data for this term; this variable serves as a dependent (criterion) variable;\r\nelapsed time – numerical variable representing the number of months that elapsed from the beginning of the time series; this variable enables estimation of the size and direction of the overall trend in the data;\r\npandemic – dichotomic variable indicating the presence/absence of pandemic; as already mentioned above, for the purpose of this analysis, the beginning of the pandemic is assumed to have started in March 2020; this variable enables estimation of the level change in the interest in work-life balance and well-being immediately after the pandemic outbreak;\r\nelapsed time after pandemic outbreak – numerical variable representing the number of months that elapsed from the beginning of pandemic; this variable enables estimation of the change in the trend in the interest in work-life balance and well-being after the outbreak of pandemic;\r\nmonth – categorical variable representing specific month within a year; this variable enables controlling for the effect of seasonality.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for data manipulation\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n# uploading data\r\ndfWorkLifeBalance <- readr::read_csv(\"./workLifeBalanceGoogleTrendData.csv\")\r\ndfWellBeing <- readr::read_csv(\"./wellBeingGoogleTrendData.csv\")\r\n\r\ndfAll <- dfWorkLifeBalance %>%\r\n  # joining both datasets\r\n  dplyr::left_join(\r\n    dfWellBeing, by = \"Month\"\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  # changing the format and name of Month variable\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    Month = stringr::str_glue(\"{Month}-01\"),\r\n    Month = lubridate::ymd(Month)\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(\r\n    date = Month\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  # creating new variable month\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    month = lubridate::month(date,label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE),\r\n    month = factor(month, \r\n                   levels = c(\"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\"), \r\n                   labels = c(\"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\", \"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\"), \r\n                   ordered = FALSE)\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  # arranging data in ascending order by date\r\n  dplyr::arrange(\r\n    date\r\n    ) %>%\r\n  # creating new variables\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    elapsedTime = row_number(),\r\n    pandemic = case_when(\r\n      date >= \"2020-03-01\" ~ 1,\r\n      TRUE ~ 0\r\n      ),\r\n    elapsedTimeAfterPandemic = cumsum(pandemic)\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(\r\n    pandemic = as.factor(case_when(\r\n        pandemic == 1 ~ \"After the pandemic outbreak\",\r\n        TRUE ~ \"Before the pandemic outbreak\"\r\n        ))\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  # changing order of variables in df\r\n  dplyr::select(\r\n    date, workLifeBalance, wellBeing, elapsedTime, month, pandemic, elapsedTimeAfterPandemic\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a table with the resulting data we will use for testing our hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for making user-friendly data table\r\nlibrary(DT)\r\n\r\nDT::datatable(\r\n  dfAll,\r\n  class = 'cell-border stripe', \r\n  filter = 'top',\r\n  extensions = 'Buttons',\r\n  fillContainer = FALSE,\r\n  rownames= FALSE,\r\n  options = list(\r\n    pageLength = 5, \r\n    autoWidth = TRUE,\r\n    dom = 'Bfrtip',\r\n    buttons = c('copy'), \r\n    scrollX = TRUE, \r\n    selection=\"multiple\"\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Final dataset used for testing hypothesis about impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s interest in work-life balance and well-being.\r\n\r\nBayesian segmented regression\r\nWe will model our data using common segmented regression models that have following general structure:\r\n\\[Y_{t} = β_{0} + β_{1}*time_{t} + β_{2}*intervention_{t} + β_{3}*time after intervention_{t} + e_{t}\\]\r\nThe β0 coefficient estimates the baseline level of the outcome variable at time zero; β1 coefficient estimates the change in the mean of the outcome variable that occurs with each unit of time before the intervention (i.e. the baseline trend); β2 coefficient estimates the level change in the mean of the outcome variable immediately after the intervention (i.e. from the end of the preceding segment); and β3 estimates the change in the trend in the mean of the outcome variable per unit of time after the intervention, compared with the trend before the intervention (thus, the sum of β1 and β3 equals to the post-intervention slope). For a better understanding of the model, take a look at the illustrative chart below.\r\n\r\nSince we are dealing with correlated and truncated data, we should also include two additional terms in our model, an autocorrelation term and a truncation term, to handle these specific properties of our data.\r\nNow let’s fit the models to the data and check what they tell us about the effect of pandemic on people’s search interest in work-life balance and well-being. We will use brms r package that enables making inferences about statistical models’ parameters within Bayesian inferential framework. Because of that, we also need to specify some additional parameters (e.g. chains, iter or warmup) of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that will generate posterior samples of our models’ parameters.\r\nBayesian framework also enables us to specify priors for estimated parameter and through them include our domain knowledge in the analysis. The specified priors are important for both parameter estimation and hypothesis testing as they define our starting information state before we take into account our data. Here we will use rather wide, uninformative, and only mildly regularizing priors (it means that the results of the inference will be very close to the results of standard, frequentist parameter estimation/hypothesis testing).\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for Bayesian statistical inference\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\n\r\n# checking available priors for the models \r\nbrms::get_prior(\r\n  workLifeBalance | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = dfAll,\r\n  family = gaussian())\r\n\r\nbrms::get_prior(\r\n  wellBeing | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = dfAll,\r\n  family = gaussian())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for Bayesian statistical inference\r\nlibrary(brms)\r\n\r\n# specifying wide, uninformative, and only mildly regularizing priors for predictors in both models \r\npriors <- c(set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"elapsedTime\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"elapsedTimeAfterPandemic\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthApr\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthAug\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthDec\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthFeb\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthJul\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthJun\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthMar\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthMay\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthNov\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthOct\"),\r\n            set_prior(\"normal(0,50)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"monthSep\"))\r\n\r\n# defining the statistical model for work-life balance\r\nmodelWorkLifeBalance <- brms::brm(\r\n  workLifeBalance | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = dfAll,\r\n  family = gaussian(),\r\n  prior = priors,\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  iter = 3000,\r\n  warmup = 1000,\r\n  seed = 12345,\r\n  sample_prior = TRUE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n# defining the statistical model for well-being\r\nmodelWellBeing <- brms::brm(\r\n  wellBeing | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ elapsedTime + pandemic + elapsedTimeAfterPandemic + month + ar(p = 1),\r\n  data = dfAll,\r\n  family = gaussian(),\r\n  prior = priors,\r\n  chains = 4,\r\n  iter = 3000,\r\n  warmup = 1000,\r\n  seed = 678910,\r\n  sample_prior = TRUE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome necessary sanity checks\r\nBefore making any inferences, we should make some sanity checks to be sure that the mechanics of the MCMC algorithm worked well and that we can use generated posterior samples for making inferences about our models’ parameters. There are many ways for doing that, but here we will use only visual check of the MCMC chains. We want plots of these chains look like hairy caterpillar which would indicate convergence of the underlying Markov chain to stationarity and convergence of Monte Carlo estimators to population quantities, respectively. As can be seen in Graph 1 and 2 below, in case of both models we can observe wanted characteristics of the MCMC chains described above. (For additional MCMC diagnostics procedures, see for example Bayesian Notes from Jeffrey B. Arnold.)\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# uploading library for plotting Bayesian models\r\nlibrary(bayesplot)\r\n\r\n# plotting the MCMC chains for the modelWorkLifeBalance \r\nbayesplot::mcmc_trace(\r\n  modelWorkLifeBalance,\r\n  facet_args = list(nrow = 6)\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Plots of the MCMC chains used for estimation of the modelWorkLifeBalance's parameters\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 1: Trace plots of Markov chains for individual parameters of the modelWorkLifeBalance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# plotting the MCMC chains for the modelWellBeing \r\nbayesplot::mcmc_trace(\r\n  modelWellBeing,\r\n  facet_args = list(nrow = 6)\r\n  ) +\r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = \"Plots of the MCMC chains used for estimation of the modelWellBeing's parameters\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 2: Trace plots of Markov chains for individual parameters of the modelWellBeing.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to check how well the models fit the data. We can use for this purpose posterior predictive checks that use specified number of sampled posterior values of models’ parameters and show how well the fitted models predict observed data. We can see in Graphs 3 and 4 that both models fit the observed data reasonably well.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# investigating modelWorkLifeBalance fit\r\n\r\n# specifying the number of samples\r\nnsamples = 1000\r\n\r\nbrms::pp_check(\r\n  modelWorkLifeBalance, \r\n  nsamples = nsamples\r\n  ) + \r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = stringr::str_glue(\"Posterior predictive checks for modelWorkLifeBalance (using {nsamples} samples)\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 3: Posterior predictive checks comparing simulated/replicated data under the fitted modelWorkLifeBalance with the observed data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# investigating modelWellBeing fit\r\n\r\n# specifying the number of samples\r\nnsamples = 1000\r\n\r\nbrms::pp_check(\r\n  modelWellBeing, \r\n  nsamples = nsamples\r\n  ) + \r\n  ggplot2::labs(\r\n    title = stringr::str_glue(\"Posterior predictive checks for modelWellBeing (using {nsamples} samples)\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph 4: Posterior predictive checks comparing simulated/replicated data under the fitted modelWellBeing with the observed data.\r\n\r\nResults of the analysis\r\nNow, after having sufficient confidence that - using terminology from the Richard McElreath’s book Statistical Rethinking - our “small worlds” can pretty accurately mimic the data coming from our real,“big world”, we can use our models’ parameters to learn something about our research questions. Our primary interest is in the coefficient value of the pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak and elapsedTimeAfterPandemic terms in our models. It expresses how much and in what direction people’s search interest in work-life balance and well-being changed immediately after the outbreak of pandemic, and how slope of the trend changed after the pandemic, respectively.\r\nIn Graph 5 and 6 we can see posterior distribution of the pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak parameter in our two models. In both cases the posterior distribution of the pandemic term is (predominantly or completely) on the left side of the zero value, which supports the claim about existence of the effect of pandemic on people’s increased search interest in work-life balance and well-being immediately after the outbreak of pandemic.

For that purpose we can extract posterior samples and use them for calculation of the proportion of values that are larger/smaller than zero. The resulting proportions show that the vast majority (around 92%) of posterior distribution lies below zero.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# extracting posterior samples\r\nsamples <- brms::posterior_samples(modelWorkLifeBalance, seed = 12345)\r\n\r\n# probability of b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak coefficient being lower than 0\r\nsum(samples$b_pandemicBeforethepandemicoutbreak < 0) / nrow(samples)\r\n\r\n[1] 0.9145\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let’s check the parameter elapsedTimeAfterPandemic.

I wish us all to be able to transform our increased interest in these topics into truly increased quality of our personal and professional lives. It would be a shame not to use that extra incentive many of us have now for making significant change in our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

V několika posledních letech potom k tomu navíc přidává nadstavbu v podobě pokročilejších analytických postupů, které mají větší potenciál přijít s hlubšími vhledy a s doporučeními s větším efektem. Ale ať už využíváte pouze základní reporting nebo nějakou pokročilejší analytiku, cíl je vždy stejný – snažit se s pomocí dat a jejich analýzy žádoucím způsobem ovlivnit jednotlivé HR procesy, které organizacím pomáhají dosahovat jejich strategických cílů. Názorně to ilustruje níže uvedené schéma zachycující mechanismus propojující HR procesy s (nejen) finančními výsledky organizace (Paauwe & Richardson, 1997).\r\n\r\nHR analytika pomáhá optimalizovat nastavení tohoto mechanismu tím, že umožňuje nalézat odpovědi na některé klíčové otázky, jako např.:\r\nKterými kanály se k nám dostávají ti nejlepší kandidáti?\r\nJaké charakteristiky od sebe odlišují úspěšné a neúspěšné kandidáty?\r\nKteré faktory přispívají k úspěšnému onboardingu?\r\nKterá „kápéíčka“ mají nejsilnější vazbu na finanční výsledky firmy?\r\nJaké tréninky vedou s nejvyšší pravděpodobností ke zlepšení pracovního výkonu?\r\nKteré intervence mají největší dopad na zaměstnanci pociťovaný well-being nebo work-life balance?\r\nCo u zaměstnanců zvyšuje, nebo naopak snižuje míru jejich angažovanosti?\r\nKde se v organizaci nachází izolovaná sila a úzká hrdla znemožňující efektivní komunikaci a spolupráci mezi jednotlivými zaměstnanci, týmy nebo i celými odděleními?\r\nKdo představuje skrytý talent, který je potřeba podchytit a dále rozvíjet?\r\nKde lze očekávat odpor v souvislosti s plánovanými změnami ve firmě a kdo naopak může být jejich ambasadorem a katalyzátorem?\r\nKteré faktory přispívají k odchodovosti zaměstnanců a u kterých konkrétních zaměstnanců je zvýšené riziko, že firmu během několika příštích měsíců opustí?\r\nOdchodovost zaměstnanců a její prediktory\r\nPrávě posledně jmenovaný způsob využití HR analytiky často představuje jeden z prvních druhů HR analytických projektů, kterými se ve firmách s HR analytikou začíná, a to z dobře pochopitelného důvodu. S nežádoucími odchody zaměstnanců jsou totiž spojené vysoké přímé i nepřímé náklady, takže i poměrně mírné snížení odchodovosti zaměstnanců může představovat značnou úsporu, kterou ocení management každé firmy. Naléhavost tohoto problému navíc ještě zvyšuje současná fáze ekonomického cyklu s rekordně nízkou mírou nezaměstnanosti, která v kombinaci s různými on-line platformami na zprostředkování práce motivuje mnoho lidí k hledání nového místa, kde, jak doufají, bude práce zajímavější, smysluplnější a lépe placená a kde kolegové budou sympatičtější a šéfové inspirativnější. Viz také graf níže, který na datech z USA názorně dokládá těsnost vztahu mezi mírou nezaměstnanosti a mírou dobrovolné odchodovosti zaměstnanců (r = -0,95, p < 0,001 ).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVzhledem k palčivosti tohoto problému, který trápí nejednu firmu, není žádným velkým překvapením, že se tématu odchodovosti zaměstnanců věnovalo a stále věnuje velké množství různých studií. Takto např. na konci roku 2017 vyšla rozsáhlá meta-analýza od autorů Rubensteina, Eberlyové a Leeho, kteří syntetizovali výsledky více než 300 dílčích výzkumů týkajících se prediktorů odchodovosti. Můžeme se tak oprávněně ptát, co nového nám může přinést HR analytika zaměřená na odchodovost zaměstnanců realizovaná pouze v jediné organizaci. Nebylo vše podstatné k tomuto tématu již objeveno? (K této otázce viz např. tento inspirativní a trochu provokativní článek od Thomase Rasmussena.) Je pravda, že není příliš pravděpodobné, že při analýze vašich vlastních dat narazíte na nějaký naprosto nový faktor související s odchodovostí. Na druhou stranu je rovněž pravda, že každá organizace je v něčem jedinečná, takže některé z retenčních faktorů pro danou organizaci budou pravděpodobně více a jiné méně důležité. Tato informace o relativní důležitosti jednotlivých retenčních faktorů je potom klíčová při nastavování retenčního plánu a HR analytika může být při tomto velice nápomocná.\r\nNa důkazech založená pro-retenční opatření\r\nS pomocí tohoto dashboardu - vytvořeného prostřednictvím analytického nástroje R a vizualizačního nástroje Shiny a za využití ukázkových dat od společnosti IBM - si můžete sami vyzkoušet, jak užitečné by pro Vás mohly být výstupy z takového HR analytického projektu zaměřeného na odchodovost zaměstnanců. Dashboard obsahuje informace, které pomáhají (nejen) managementu zodpovědět řadu klíčových otázek, které stojí na počátku každého účinného plánu na retenci zaměstnanců, jako např.:\r\nKolik zaměstnanců nás ročně opouští?\r\nKteré skupiny zaměstnanců odcházejí nejčastěji?\r\nJaký je externí benchmark? Jsme na tom podobě jako konkurence v oboru?\r\nPředstavuje pro nás stávající úroveň odchodovosti závažný problém, a vyplatí se nám ho tedy řešit?\r\nZ jakých důvodů lidé obecně nejčastěji odcházejí ze zaměstnání?\r\nJaké faktory přispívají k odchodu specificky našich zaměstnanců?\r\nJaká pro-retenční opatření jsou obecně k dispozici?\r\nJaká pro-retenční opatření bychom měli zvolit vzhledem k pravděpodobným důvodům odchodů našich zaměstnanců?\r\nNa jaké skupiny zaměstnanců se především zaměřit z hlediska prevence jejich odchodovosti?\r\nU kterých konkrétních zaměstnanců existuje zvýšené riziko, že odejdou, a na jaké konkrétní retenční faktory se u nich zaměřit v rámci pravidelného stay interview?\r\nJak je z výše uvedeného výčtu otázek patrné, dashboard obsahuje informace, které při svém rozhodování mohou využít nejen HR manažeři, ale také HR business partneři nebo přímo team-leadeři a linioví manažeři jednotlivých týmů či oddělení. Kromě toho dashboard obsahuje také řadu technických detailů o použitém predikčním modelu a samotná data, které stojí v pozadí všech prezentovaných vizualizací a analýz. S jejich pomocí tak HR/Business analytik může např. hledat optimální způsob, jak nastavit skórovací algoritmus, aby se maximalizoval pozitivní efekt pro-retenčních opatření, nebo může v dostupných datech sám hledat nějaké další užitečné informace. Více viz již samotný dashboard, z něhož můžete níže vidět několik screenshotů.\r\nScreenshot části dashboardu, která obsahuje různé řezy odchodovostí zaměstnanců, a dává tak dobrý přehled o tom, které skupiny zaměstnanců jsou odchodovostí nejvíce ohrožené.\r\nScreenshot části dashboardu, která obsahuje informace o pravděpodobnosti odchodu jednotlivých zaměstnanců společně s dalšími informacemi, které mohou posloužit jako podklad pro individuální intervence s cílem předejít nežádoucím odchodům zaměstnanců.\r\n\r\nScreenshot části dashboardu, která obsahuje informace o výkonu/kvalitě statistického modelu použitého k identifikaci významných prediktorů odchodovosti zaměstnanců a k odhadu pravděpodobnosti odchodu jednotlivých zaměstnanců.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Přes popularitu tématu HR analytiky mezi HR profesionály je stále relativně málo společností, které HR analytiku reálně a systematicky využívají. Jednou z možných příčin je to, že tradiční HR mnohdy postrádá analytický mindset a některé z kompetencí, které jsou klíčové pro úspěšnou realizaci HR analytických projektů. V takové situaci může být užitečné podívat se ve větším detailu na celkovou logiku i na konkrétní analytické kroky nějakého úspěšného příkladu využití HR analytiky k optimalizaci některého z HR procesů s pozitivním dopadem na obchodní výsledky společnosti. V tomto článku se tímto způsobem podíváme na známý příběh oaklandského baseballového týmu \"Áček\", jehož management poměrně radikálně - a podle všeho i úspěšně - přehodnotil svůj dosavadní přístup k výběru nových hráčů na základě výstupů statistické analýzy sabermetrických dat o herním chování hráčů. Využijeme při tom volně dostupný statistický software R a veřejně dostupnou databázi historických údajů o výsledcích v americké baseballové lize.",

Téměř\r\nvšichni z oboru už o HR analytice něco slyšeli, něco o ní vědí a\r\npřípadně se jí už také pokouší ve svých organizacích v nějaké podobě\r\nzavádět. Zároveň většinou uznávají její důležitost při transformaci HR z\r\npodpůrné a administrativní funkce na funkci, která dokáže organizacím\r\nbezprostředně pomáhat dosahovat jejich strategických cílů. Navzdory\r\ntomuto všeobecnému povědomí o HR analytice a navzdory řadě úspěšně\r\nrealizovaných HR analytických projektů (viz např. série článků od Davida Greena - článek\r\n1, článek\r\n2, článek\r\n3, článek\r\n4) překvapivě málo organizací HR analytiku reálně a systematicky\r\nvyužívá. Tento stav reflektují i výsledky výzkumu 2018\r\nHuman Capital Trends od společnosti Deloitte, ze kterých vyplývá, že\r\norganizace si většinou uvědomují strategickou důležitost výzvy, kterou\r\npředstavuje datifikace HR, zároveň se ale necítí být na čelení této\r\nvýzvě příliš dobře připraveny. Už nějakou dobu platí, že když už se v\r\norganizaci s HR daty nějak pracuje, tak je to většinou pouze na úrovni\r\nnějakého základního reportingu vybraných HR metrik a KPIs typu náklady\r\nna nábor, délka období neobsazenosti volné pracovní pozice, míra\r\nne/dobrovolné odchodovosti zaměstnanců, počet zaměstnanců na jednoho HR\r\nbusiness partnera apod. Slabinou tohoto přístupu je, že takto sledované\r\nmetriky jsou často relevantní pouze pro monitorování a řízení\r\nefektivnosti HR coby nákladového střediska, ale již méně pro dosahování\r\nstrategických cílů organizace. Spíše výjimečně se potom v tomto kontextu\r\nvyužívají nějaké pokročilejší analytiky, které obecně mají větší\r\npotenciál přicházet s doporučeními s přímým dopadem na schopnost\r\norganizací dosahovat svých strategických cílů.\r\nVýsledky výzkumu\r\nprovedeného společnostmi MIT Sloan Management Review a SAS\r\nnaznačují, že tento nevyužitý potenciál HR analytiky má dvě hlavní\r\npříčiny. První z nich je to, že tradiční HR mnohdy postrádá analytický\r\nmindset a některé z kompetencí, které jsou klíčové pro úspěšnou\r\nrealizaci HR analytických projektů (přehled těchto kompetencí a důsledků\r\njejich absence či nedostatečné úrovně viz např. tento\r\nčlánek od Mortena Kamp\r\nAndersena). Ve stejném duchu Josh Bersin ve své zprávě\r\nHR\r\nTechnology Disruptions for 2018 konstatuje, že zvládnutí základních\r\nanalytických dovedností patří mezi nejdůležitější prediktory efektivní\r\nimplementace HR analytiky v organizacích: “Equip all HR staff with\r\nbasic data literacy skills. All HR practitioners should know basic\r\nstatistical concepts, where to find data, how to slice and dice it, how\r\nto read a dashboard, and how to bring data and analytics to bear on\r\nbusiness issues. Our research reveals that such basic skills are among\r\nthe most important predictors of high-performing people\r\nanalytics.”\r\nDruhou hlavní příčinou je potom to, že HR analytické projekty\r\nnebývají ukotveny v rámci nějaké širší strategie, jak data systematicky\r\nvyužívat při řízení lidských zdrojů, navíc způsobem, který by byl\r\nsladěný se strategickými cíli společnosti. Zde platí praxí osvědčená\r\npravda projektového managementu, že při implementaci projektů je potřeba\r\nvždy začínat od konce. V kontextu HR analytických projektů to tedy\r\nznamená začínat nikoli od dat, ale od toho, k čemu mají být HR\r\nanalytické výstupy použity. A očekávání managementu je, že HR analytika\r\nbude v posledku hlavně pomáhat zlepšovat obchodní výsledky společnosti.\r\nNázorně to ilustruje níže uvedené schéma (převzaté z článku\r\nMaxe Blumberga),\r\nkteré zachycuje předpokládaný kauzální řetězec spojující HR procesy s\r\nobchodními výsledky. Úkolem HR analytiky je potom s pomocí dat a\r\nanalytických nástrojů tyto dvě oblasti propojit a zjistit, jak\r\noptimalizací prvního zajistit zlepšení toho druhého.\r\n\r\nŘadě organizací by v tomto ohledu mohl být inspirací známý příběh oaklandského\r\nbaseballového týmu „Áček“, který se stal předlohou pro knihu Moneyball a z\r\nní vycházející stejnojmenný film.\r\nPrávě tento příběh jako jeden z prvních ukázal a mezi širokou veřejností\r\nzpopularizoval možnosti využití statistické analýzy ve světě sportu a\r\npotažmo také v rámci řízení lidských zdrojů. Díky radikální změně\r\ndosavadního přístupu k výběru nových hráčů, který se začal více opírat o\r\nvýstupy statistické analýzy sabermetrických\r\ndat o herním chování hráčů, dokázal management oaklandského\r\nbaseballového týmu „Áček“ přijímat rozhodnutí, která z jednoho z\r\nnejchudších týmů americké baseballové ligy učinila jeden z\r\nnejúspěšnějších týmů soutěže (měřeno počtem vítězství v základní části\r\nsoutěže a počtem postupů do play-off). Abychom mohli tento příběh plně\r\nvytěžit coby inspiraci, jak analyzovat svá vlastní zaměstnanecká data,\r\nbude užitečné, když se na jednotlivé analytické kroky, které stály v\r\npozadí úspěchu oklandských “Áček”, podíváme trochu podrobněji. A učiníme\r\ntak za využití volně dostupného statistického softwaru R a veřejně\r\ndostupné databáze\r\nhistorických údajů o výsledcích v americké baseballové lize.\r\n1.\r\nkrok: Začít od konce aneb strategický rámec HR analytiky\r\nJak bylo uvedeno výše, často podceňovaným krokem při zavádění HR\r\nanalytiky do firem a organizací je zasazení HR analytiky do nějakého\r\nširšího strategického rámce, ze kterého by jasně vyplývalo, čemu má\r\nvlastně HR analytika sloužit. HR analytika je pouze nástroj, konkrétně\r\nnástroj na zodpovídání otázek, resp. na testování různých hypotéz. To,\r\nzda bude tento nástroj užitečný, závisí na tom, zda si dokážeme klást ty\r\nsprávné otázky. To je přitom z velké části dáno tím, zda si jsme vědomi,\r\njaké jsou strategické cíle naší organizace. Jen ve světle těchto cílů\r\ndává smysl klást si nějaké otázky, sbírat a analyzovat nějaká data za\r\núčelem nalezení odpovědí na položené otázky a posléze činit nějaká\r\nkonkrétní rozhodnutí na základě nalezených odpovědí. V případě\r\noaklandských „Áček“ byl cíl jasný – kvalifikovat se do play-off.\r\n2. krok: Definice\r\nproblému a kvantifikace cíle\r\nPaul\r\nDePodesta, kterého generální manažer oaklandských „Áček“ Billy Beane přijal\r\ndo týmu jako statistického analytika, redukoval tento cíl na celkem\r\njednoduchý matematický problém: Kolik zápasů musí tým vyhrát, aby se\r\nkvalifikoval do play-off? K zodpovězení této otázky DePodesta potřeboval\r\nhistorická data o počtu vítězství jednotlivých týmů v minulých sezónách\r\na o tom, zda se jim podařilo postoupit do play-off, či nikoli.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Načtěme si knihovnu, která nám umožní si načíst a předpřipravit data k analýze a také je i vizualizovat. \r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n# Načteme si naše data.\r\nbaseball <- read_csv(\"baseball.csv\")\r\n\r\n# Pro získání lepší představy o nich se podívejme na jejich prvních deset řádků.\r\nhead(baseball, 10)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 x 15\r\n   Team  League  Year    RS    RA     W   OBP   SLG    BA Playoffs\r\n   <chr> <chr>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>\r\n 1 ARI   NL      2012   734   688    81 0.328 0.418 0.259        0\r\n 2 ATL   NL      2012   700   600    94 0.32  0.389 0.247        1\r\n 3 BAL   AL      2012   712   705    93 0.311 0.417 0.247        1\r\n 4 BOS   AL      2012   734   806    69 0.315 0.415 0.26         0\r\n 5 CHC   NL      2012   613   759    61 0.302 0.378 0.24         0\r\n 6 CHW   AL      2012   748   676    85 0.318 0.422 0.255        0\r\n 7 CIN   NL      2012   669   588    97 0.315 0.411 0.251        1\r\n 8 CLE   AL      2012   667   845    68 0.324 0.381 0.251        0\r\n 9 COL   NL      2012   758   890    64 0.33  0.436 0.274        0\r\n10 DET   AL      2012   726   670    88 0.335 0.422 0.268        1\r\n# ... with 5 more variables: RankSeason <dbl>, RankPlayoffs <dbl>,\r\n#   G <dbl>, OOBP <dbl>, OSLG <dbl>\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Pro následující analýzy si potom vytvořme podmnožinu dat, která měli k dispozici v Oaklandu v roce 2002, kdy se děj Moneyballu převážně odehrává.\r\nmoneyball <- baseball %>%\r\n  filter(Year < 2002)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPodíváme-li se na data mezi lety 1996–2001, tj. na data z relativně\r\nnedávné minulosti (vztaženo k roku 2002, kdy se děj Moneyballu převážně\r\nodehrává), z grafického vyjádření vztahu mezi počtem vítězství v\r\nzákladní částí soutěže a postupem do play-off je dobře patrné, že čím\r\nvíce zápasů tým vyhraje v základní soutěži, tím větší je šance, že se\r\ntaké dostane do play-off.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Vytvořme si graf zachycující vztah mezi počtem vítězství v základní části soutěže a postupem do play-off\r\nmoneyball %>%\r\n  filter(Year < 2002 & Year > 1995) %>%\r\n  select (W, Playoffs) %>%\r\n  mutate(rnd = runif(176,0,1)) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = W, y = rnd, color = as.factor(Playoffs)))+\r\n  geom_point(size = 2)+\r\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(50,120), breaks = seq(50,120,5))+\r\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#9e9e9e\", \"#ff1919\"), labels = c(\"Tým nepostoupil do play-off\",\"Tým postoupil do play-off\"))+\r\n  ggtitle(\"Postupy týmů do play-off mezi lety 1996-2001\")+\r\n  ylab(\"\")+\r\n  xlab(\"Počet vítězství v základní části soutěže\")+\r\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\r\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\r\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\r\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size=11),\r\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size=11),\r\n        legend.text = element_text(size=11),\r\n        legend.title = element_blank())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS daty, která máme k dispozici, máme tu výhodu, že můžeme vztah mezi\r\npočtem vítězství v základní části soutěže a šancí na postup do play-off\r\npřesně kvantifikovat. Provedeme-li podrobnější analýzu našich dat, ukáže\r\nse, že velkou (přibližně 95%) šanci na postup do play-off má tým tehdy,\r\nkdyž v základní části vyhraje minimálně 95 zápasů. Těchto 95 vítězství\r\npředstavuje dobře definovaný a kvantifikovaný cíl, kterého by se\r\noaklandská „Áčka“ měla snažit dosáhnout.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Vyfiltrujme si opět data mezi lety 1996-2001. \r\nmoneyball2 <- moneyball %>%\r\n  filter(Year < 2002 & Year > 1995)\r\n\r\n# Vytvořme si seznam několika různých hodnot počtu vítězství v základní části soutěže.\r\npocet_vitezstvi <- seq(60,115,5)\r\nucast_v_playoff <- vector(mode=\"numeric\", length=length(pocet_vitezstvi))\r\nplayoff_data <- data.frame(pocet_vitezstvi = pocet_vitezstvi, ucast_v_playoff = ucast_v_playoff)\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si, jaká je pravděpodobnost postupu do play-off při různém počtu vítězství v základní části soutěže.\r\nfor(i in 1:nrow(playoff_data)){\r\n playoff_data$ucast_v_playoff[i] <- length(moneyball2$W[moneyball2$W >= playoff_data$pocet_vitezstvi[i] & moneyball2$Playoffs == 1])/length(moneyball2$W[moneyball2$W >= playoff_data$pocet_vitezstvi[i]]) \r\n}\r\n\r\n# A nyní si vztah mezi počtem vyhraných zápasů v základní části soutěže a pravděpodobností účasti v play-off vizualizujme.\r\nggplot(playoff_data, aes(x = pocet_vitezstvi, y = ucast_v_playoff))+\r\n  geom_point(size = 2)+\r\n  geom_line()+\r\n  ggtitle(\"Souvislost mezi počtem výher v základní části soutěže a\\npravděpodobností postupu týmu do play-off (1996-2001)\")+\r\n  ylab(\"Pravděpodobnost postupu týmu do play-off\")+\r\n  xlab(\"Počet vítězství v základní části soutěže\")+\r\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(60,115), breaks = seq(60,115,5))+\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1), breaks = seq(0,1,0.1))+\r\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size=11),\r\n        axis.title = element_text(size=11))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. krok: Kladení otázek a\r\nměření\r\nS takto definovaným a kvantifikovaným cílem si potom můžeme klást\r\ndalších otázky, na které když si dokážeme odpovědět, zvýšíme tím naše\r\nšance na to, že tohoto cíle dosáhneme. V případě oaklandských „Áček“ se\r\nmůžeme ptát, díky čemu tým dosahuje v zápasech vítězství? Celkem zjevná\r\nodpověď zní, že díky tomu, že dokáže získat více bodů než jeho soupeři.\r\nOtázkou ale je, přesně o kolik bodů navíc musí tým získat, aby v\r\nzákladní části soutěže dosáhl na minimálně 95 vítězství. K zodpovězení\r\ntéto otázky opět potřebujeme historická data (údaje o vyhraných a\r\nprohraných bodech) a relativně jednoduchý statistický model zvaný lineární\r\nregrese, pomocí kterého můžeme popsat vztah mezi počtem vyhraných\r\nzápasů v základní části soutěže a rozdílem mezi vyhranými a prohranými\r\nbody.

Tzn., že při vyrovnaném poměru\r\nvyhraných a prohraných bodů můžeme očekávat, že tým vyhraje přibližně 80\r\nzápasů za sezónu, a že když se rozdílové skóre navýší o deset bodů,\r\nmůžeme očekávat, že tým vyhraje v průměru o jeden zápas za sezónu navíc.\r\nKlíčové je ale pro nás to, že s pomocí této rovnice a s trochou algebry\r\nsi můžeme jednoduše vypočítat, že k dosažení minimálně 95 vítězství za\r\nsezónu potřebuje tým vyhrát přibližně o 133 bodů více, než kolik jich se\r\nsoupeři prohraje ((95 - 80.88) / 0.106).\r\n4. krok: Kladení\r\ndalších otázek a další měření\r\nTímto zjištěním se náš cíl opět trochu více specifikuje a vyvolává\r\ndalší otázky. Otázka, která se téměř sama nabízí, se týká charakteristik\r\nhráčů, které nejlépe předpovídají počet vyhraných a prohraných bodů, a\r\ntím tedy také pravděpodobnost postupu týmu do play-off. DePodesta na\r\nzákladě svých analýz zjistil, že počet vyhraných bodů nejtěsněji souvisí\r\ns procentem případů, kdy se hráč dostane na metu (tzv. On-Base\r\nPercentage - OBP), a to, jak daleko se hráč dostane při svém odpalu\r\n(tzv. Slugging Percentage - SLG). Analogické statistiky pro\r\ntýmy soupeřů (OOBP a OSLG) potom stejně dobře předpovídají počet\r\nprohraných bodů. Když vztah mezi těmito proměnnými popíšeme opět pomocí\r\nmodelu lineární regrese, můžeme se s jeho pomocí pokusit předpovědět,\r\njak si tým povede příští sezónu. Taková předpověď by přitom mohla být\r\npotenciálně velice užitečná, protože na jejím základě bychom případně\r\nmohli upravit některá svá rozhodnutí o koupi nebo prodeji vybraných\r\nhráčů. Pojďme tuto předpověď vytvořit pro tým oaklandských „Áček“ pro\r\nsezónu 2002 na základě dat z let 1962-2001. Z předchozí analýzy již\r\nvíme, že…\r\nPočet vítězství = 80.88 + 0.106 x (Počet vyhraných bodů - Počet\r\nprohraných bodů).\r\nNyní potřebujeme určit, jaký bude pravděpodobný počet vyhraných a\r\nprohraných bodů.

V něm budou mít\r\noaklandská “Áčka” podobu jednoduchého stroje na výrobu postupů do\r\nplay-off - viz obrázek níže.\r\n\r\nZe schématu je dobře patrné, jak tento stroj funguje: Jeho výstupy\r\njsou postupy do play-off, kterých dosahuje tak, že se snaží vyhrát více\r\nzápasů, resp. získat více bodů než soupeřící týmy; k tomu využívá vstupy\r\nv podobě schopnosti hráčů hrát dobře na pálce a v poli; vstupem\r\novlivňujícím chod stroje jsou rovněž obdobné schopnosti hráčů\r\nsoupeřících týmů. Jedná se samozřejmě o velmi zjednodušený kauzální\r\nmodel fungování týmu oakladnských “Áček”, ale jak konstatuje slavný\r\nstatistický aforismus, modely jsou\r\nvždy nepřesné, ale některé z nich jsou užitečné.\r\nJakkoli naše modely fungování organizace budou vždy neúplné, je\r\ndůležité ověřit, zda tyto modely i přes svou omezenost v dostatečné míře\r\nodrážejí realitu tak, jak nám ji zprostředkovávají dostupná data. Za\r\ntímto účelem můžeme použít statistickou metodu strukturálního\r\nmodelování, která umožňuje formalizovat naše představy o vzájemných\r\nvztazích mezi několika různými proměnnými a zhodnotit míru souladu\r\ntěchto našich představ s dostupnými daty.

RMSEA, a také vysoké hodnoty standardizovaných\r\nregresních koeficientů). Dávají nám tak dobrý důvod věřit, že naše další\r\nkroky a rozhodnutí, která založíme na tomto modelu, budou mít žádoucí\r\nefekt na požadované výstupy, tj. na postup oaklandských “Áček” do\r\nplay-off.\r\n6. krok: Intervence\r\nNa základě výše uvedených zjištění začal management oaklandských\r\n„Áček“ do svého týmu vybírat hráče, kteří sice nevyhovovali tradičním\r\nkritériím, podle kterých hráčští skauti posuzovali kvalitu baseballových\r\nhráčů, ale za to vykazovali přesně ty charakteristiky, které podle\r\nDePodestových analýz předpovídaly počet vyhraných a prohraných bodů, a\r\npotažmo tedy také pravděpodobnost účasti v play-off, která byla hlavním\r\ncílem managementu. Díky tomu, že konkurenční týmy důležitost těchto\r\nhráčských statistik podceňovaly a naopak přeceňovaly jiné, méně důležité\r\nproměnné (např. míru úspěšnosti odpalů, tzv. Batting Average),\r\nmohl management oaklandských „Áček“ relativně levně skupovat hráče,\r\nkteří jim umožňovali dosahovat stanoveného cíle. Výsledkem bylo to, že\r\noaklandská „Áčka“ vyhrávala zhruba o 20 zápasů za sezónu více než stejně\r\n„chudé“ týmy a přibližně stejně tolik zápasů jako 2krát až 3krát bohatší\r\nkonkurence - viz graf níže.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Načtěme si potřebná data Lahmanovy baseballové databáze, která je veřejně přístupná na adrese http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/\r\nmzdyHracu <- read_csv(\"salaries.csv\")\r\nvyhryTymu <- read_csv(\"teams.csv\")\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si průměrnou sumu mezd vyplácených jednotlivými týmy svým hráčům v letech 1998-2001 \r\nprumerna_suma_MezdHracu <- mzdyHracu %>%\r\n  filter(yearID > 1997 & yearID < 2002) %>%\r\n  group_by(teamID) %>%\r\n  summarise(prumerna_suma_MezdHracu = sum(salary)/length(unique(yearID)))\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si pro jednotlivé týmy průměrný počet výher za sezónu v letech 1998-2001\r\nprumerny_pocet_vyher <- vyhryTymu %>%\r\n  filter(yearID > 1997 & yearID < 2002) %>%\r\n  group_by(teamID) %>%\r\n  summarise(prumerny_pocet_vyher = sum(W)/length(unique(yearID)))\r\n\r\n# Vyjádřeme si graficky vztah mezi počtem výher a množstvím peněz, které týmy vynakládají na mzdy svých hráčů \r\nlibrary(ggrepel)\r\nprumerna_suma_MezdHracu %>%\r\n  left_join(prumerny_pocet_vyher, \"teamID\") %>%\r\n  mutate(OAK = ifelse(teamID == \"OAK\", \"ano\", \"ne\")) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x= prumerna_suma_MezdHracu, y = prumerny_pocet_vyher, fill = OAK)) +\r\n  geom_point()+\r\n  ggtitle(\"Mzdy hráčů a počet vítězství v letech 1998-2001\")+\r\n  xlab(\"Průměrná suma mezd hráčů (USD)\")+\r\n  ylab(\"Průměrný počet výher za sezónu\")+\r\n  geom_label_repel(\r\n    aes(label = teamID),\r\n    box.padding = 0.25, point.padding = 0.25,\r\n    segment.color = 'grey50')+\r\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")+\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#ffd400\", \"#ffffff\"), \r\n                        labels = c(\"ano\",\"ne\"))+\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(65,100), breaks = seq(65,100,5)) +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(2e+07,9e+07), breaks = seq(2e+07,9e+07,1e+07))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmezení HR analytiky\r\nPřes veškerou přidanou hodnotu, kterou HR analytika pro organizaci\r\nmůže mít, je vhodné si vůči ní zachovat zdravou míru skepse a být si\r\nvědom jejích omezení. Níže uvádím přehled několika z nich.\r\nKvalita a užitečnost výstupů HR analytiky je závislá na kvalitě\r\ndat, která do ní vstupují. Jako kdekoli jinde i zde platí okřídlené\r\nrčení „rubbish in, rubbish out“. Schopnost získat potřebná data\r\nvčas, v dostatečné kvalitě a v dostatečném množství přitom představuje\r\njedno z nejužších hrdel celého procesu zavádění HR analytiky v\r\norganizacích.\r\nHR analytika pracuje s historickými daty a vychází z předpokladu,\r\nže minulost je dobrým prediktorem budoucnosti. Ale jak nás na to\r\nopakovaně upozorňují odborníci jako Nassim\r\nTaleb nebo Philip\r\nTetlock, tento vztah mezi minulostí a budoucností platí pouze do\r\nurčité míry a pouze v relativně krátkém časovém horizontu. Na každém\r\nrohu na nás číhá nějaká potenciální černá\r\nlabuť, která může postavit na hlavu všechno, co jsme se na základě\r\nnašich minulých zkušeností naučili brát jako samozřejmou\r\njistotu.\r\nNe každé prostředí je stejně předvídatelné jako svět sportu.\r\nPoměr signálu\r\na šumu se může napříč různými oblastmi významně lišit a čím více\r\npřevládá náhodný šum nad signálem, tím méně jsou výstupy z HR analytiky\r\nužitečné. Příkladem zde může být relativně neúspěšná snaha předpovídat\r\nto, jak si baseballové týmu povedou v play-off. Na rozdíl od základní\r\nčásti soutěže, kde se hraje dostatek zápasů na to, aby se vyrušil vliv\r\nnáhodného štěstí a smůly, v pětizápasových kolech play-off hraje náhoda\r\ntak významnou roli, že souvislost mezi celkovým počtem vítězství v\r\nzákladní části a pořadím týmu v play-off je téměř nulová.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Vyfiltrujme si data mezi lety 1994-2011, kdy v play-off hraje 8 týmů.\r\nmoneyball3 <- moneyball %>%\r\n  filter(Year < 2012 & Year > 1993)\r\n  \r\n# Výpočtěme si Kendallovu pořadovou korelaci mezi mezi celkovýmm počtem vítězství v základní části soutěže a pořadím týmu v play-off mezi lety 1994-2011. \r\nsuppressWarnings(cor.test(~ W + RankPlayoffs, data = moneyball3, method = \"kendall\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Kendall's rank correlation tau\r\n\r\ndata:  W and RankPlayoffs\r\nz = -0.48318, p-value = 0.629\r\nalternative hypothesis: true tau is not equal to 0\r\nsample estimates:\r\n        tau \r\n-0.05541167 \r\n\r\nČísla mají tu zvláštní moc, že dokážou v člověku velice snadno\r\nvzbudit dojem, že toho víme mnohem více než je tomu ve skutečnosti. Je\r\nvšak dobré si být vědom toho, že každá statistická předpověď je vždy\r\nzatížena nějakou mírou chyby, tu větší, tu menší. Velkou výhodou\r\nstatistických modelů je to, že tato chyba je u nich explicitně\r\nvyčíslena, takže s ní lze dopředu počítat a zohlednit ji při následném\r\nrozhodování. Tato „upřímnost“ ohledně své vlastní omylnosti paradoxně\r\nmnohdy staví statistické modely do horšího světla než jinak méně přesné\r\nintuitivní úsudky expertů, pro které podobné údaje o míře jejich\r\nomylnosti většinou nejsou vůbec k dispozici.\r\nVelikost výhody, kterou nám zavedení HR analytiky dává, může být\r\nzávislá na tom, zda podobné postupy využívá také naše konkurence. Opět\r\nto lze celkem dobře doložit na oaklandských „Áčkách“. Jejich výsledky se\r\nmezi lety 2002 až 2012, tj. v době po zveřejnění Moneyballu, kdy již\r\nvšechny týmy měly příležitost seznámit se s principy prediktivní\r\nanalytiky a zavést ji do své praxe, začaly více přibližovat výsledkům\r\npodobně „chudých“ soupeřů a naopak jejich bohatší soupeři jim svým\r\nvýkonem zase trochu odskočili - viz graf níže. Z toho mimo jiné vyplývá,\r\nže s tím, jak se stále více společností bude při řízení lidských zdrojů\r\nspoléhat na výstupy z HR analytiky, přestane být HR analytika nějakou\r\nzásadní konkurenční výhodou a stane se z ní něco, co organizaci “pouze”\r\numožní držet krok s konkurencí.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si průměrnou sumu mezd vyplácených jednotlivými týmy svým hráčům v letech 2002-2012 \r\nprumerna_suma_MezdHracu2 <- mzdyHracu %>%\r\n  filter(yearID > 2001 & yearID <= 2012) %>%\r\n  group_by(teamID) %>%\r\n  summarise(prumerna_suma_MezdHracu = sum(salary)/length(unique(yearID)))\r\n\r\n# Vypočtěme si pro jednotlivé týmy průměrný počet výher za sezónu v letech 2002-2012\r\nprumerny_pocet_vyher2 <- vyhryTymu %>%\r\n  filter(yearID > 2001 & yearID <=2012) %>%\r\n  group_by(teamID) %>%\r\n  summarise(prumerny_pocet_vyher = sum(W)/length(unique(yearID)))\r\n\r\n# Vyjádřeme si graficky vztah mezi počtem výher a množstvím peněz, které týmy vynakládají na mzdy svých hráčů \r\nprumerna_suma_MezdHracu2 %>%\r\n  left_join(prumerny_pocet_vyher2, \"teamID\") %>%\r\n  mutate(OAK = ifelse(teamID == \"OAK\", \"ano\", \"ne\")) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x= prumerna_suma_MezdHracu, y = prumerny_pocet_vyher, fill = OAK)) +\r\n  geom_point()+\r\n  ggtitle(\"Mzdy hráčů a počet vítězství v letech 2002-2012\")+\r\n  xlab(\"Průměrná suma mezd hráčů (USD)\")+\r\n  ylab(\"Průměrný počet výher za sezónu\")+\r\n  geom_label_repel(\r\n    aes(label = teamID),\r\n    box.padding = 0.25, point.padding = 0.25,\r\n    segment.color = 'grey50')+\r\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")+\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#ffd400\", \"#ffffff\"), \r\n                        labels = c(\"ano\",\"ne\")) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(65,100), breaks = seq(65,100,5)) +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(3e+07,2e+08), breaks = seq(3e+07,2e+08,2e+07))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZávěr\r\nNa příkladu oaklandského baseballového mužstva jsme takto mohli\r\nsledovat obvyklý postup aplikace HR analytiky na určitý druh problému,\r\nkterý se snaží v dané organizaci vyřešit. Vzhledem ke specifickému\r\npředmětu podnikání oaklandských „Áček“ bylo tímto cílem dosáhnout\r\npostupu do play-off a to v situaci, kdy management neměl dostatek\r\nfinančních prostředků na zaplacení hráčů považovaných dle tradičních\r\nměřítek za kvalitní a perspektivní. Od tohoto cíle se potom odvíjela\r\nřada kroků, které blíže specifikovaly jeho povahu a identifikovaly\r\nfaktory (mimo jiné i ty personální), které s jeho dosažením souvisí. Na\r\nzákladě této znalosti potom bylo možné formulovat určité předpovědi a\r\nučinit jistá rozhodnutí, která zvýšila pravděpodobnost toho, že se\r\npodaří vytčeného cíle dosáhnout. Přestože tento příběh o využití HR\r\nanalytiky se odehrál ve světě sportu, jeho logika je platná i v kontextu\r\ntradičnějšího typu organizací. Ostatně ve všech typech\r\norganizací jde nakonec především o to mít na správném místě a ve správný\r\nčas ty správné lidi - jedině tak tyto organizace mohou\r\nsystematicky dosahovat svých strategických cílů.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
