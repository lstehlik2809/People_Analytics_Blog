You're dreaming if you're expecting to grow financially with them...

You will be expected to do a LOT beyond your customer engagement (up to 20 hours a week and sometimes more) with very little recognition. The joke is that you will hear a lot of music about work life balance...

Huge focus on a single subjectively negative appraisal over 10s of positive client recognized impacts. This will also impact your promotion and salary increase, if it ever happen (hope you will not be shocked with 50£ and 100£ hikes)

If you have an alternative offer, please do not overvalue Deloitte as a brand or company. Never take their offer if it's not better than the competition as you will be squeezed for every single penny you will be getting.

Be very careful with the HR and recruitment team, they are expert MANIPULATORS. They will put every pressure on you to make you feel like you will be losing a lot by no immediately accepting an offer that is not aligned with what you want. The recruitment process might take 9-12 months and they will almost seem to be proud of it, but they will ask you to think over a scrap offer overnight hinting that they have a lot of applicants waiting for the role...

Not aligned to what other consultancies do, You will be expected to pay you lunch, drinks and coffees even if you are travelling to the south pole to deliver a client project.

Don't expect to have the right support to grow. You will be thrown in the middle of the pacific and expected to reach California by yourself. Very poor coaching and average/limited training offering.

Few of my colleagues reported that they have seen a last minute change to the offer bringing the salary and the grade to lower levels while they have been promised that they will be able to get it back in 1 year and as you might be thinking: Dream on; no one of them have been able to get what he expected in day 1 after the 1st year. I came to infer that this is some sort of practice to source high caliber profiler for lower salaries, get them into clients for very high rates (sometime 2 grades higher) while they will never feel that on their salary, promotion or even recognition.

Not aligned to what other consultancies do, You will be expected to pay you lunch, drinks and coffees even if you are travelling to the south pole to deliver a client project.

Don't expect to have the right support to grow. You will be thrown in the middle of the pacific and expected to reach California by yourself. Very poor coaching and average/limited training offering.

Few of my colleagues reported that they have seen a last minute change to the offer bringing the salary and the grade to lower levels while they have been promised that they will be able to get it back in 1 year and as you might be thinking: Dream on; no one of them have been able to get what he expected in day 1 after the 1st year. I came to infer that this is some sort of practice to source high caliber profiler for lower salaries, get them into clients for very high rates (sometime 2 grades higher) while they will never feel that on their salary, promotion or even recognition.

PLEASE, be careful of what choice you're making before joining. I sincerely hope you will not be deeply disappointed and (hate yourself and) regret the day you accepted their offer.",low salaries and grades
492,"Tailored for Partner's.

You're dreaming if you're expecting to grow financially with them...

You will be expected to do a LOT beyond your customer engagement (up to 20 hours a week and sometimes more) with very little recognition. The joke is that you will hear a lot of music about work life balance...

Huge focus on a single subjectively negative appraisal over 10s of positive client recognized impacts. This will also impact your promotion and salary increase, if it ever happen (hope you will not be shocked with 50£ and 100£ hikes)

If you have an alternative offer, please do not overvalue Deloitte as a brand or company. Never take their offer if it's not better than the competition as you will be squeezed for every single penny you will be getting.

Be very careful with the HR and recruitment team, they are expert MANIPULATORS. They will put every pressure on you to make you feel like you will be losing a lot by no immediately accepting an offer that is not aligned with what you want. The recruitment process might take 9-12 months and they will almost seem to be proud of it, but they will ask you to think over a scrap offer overnight hinting that they have a lot of applicants waiting for the role...
