<div class="d-article">
<p>I recently came across a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1293171/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;utm_source=sfmc&amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=MRK_2309690_a0P58000000G0YfEAK_Psycho_20240227_arts_A&amp;utm_campaign=Article%20Alerts%20V4.1-Frontiers&amp;id_mc=312035856&amp;utm_id=2309690&amp;Business_Goal=%25%25__AdditionalEmailAttribute1%25%25&amp;Audience=%25%25__AdditionalEmailAttribute2%25%25&amp;Email_Category=%25%25__AdditionalEmailAttribute3%25%25&amp;Channel=%25%25__AdditionalEmailAttribute4%25%25&amp;BusinessGoal_Audience_EmailCategory_Channel=%25%25__AdditionalEmailAttribute5%25%25" target="_blank">qualitative study</a> that used interviews with NHS Covid staff to explore the impact of working in COVID during a pandemic on their experience, ability to work effectively together and the impact of social dynamics (e.g. cohesion, social support) on teamwork and mental health.</p>
<p>What particularly caught my attention was usage of network graph modeling for capturing overarching thematic clusters based on the co-occurrences of themes in the thematically coded interview transcripts.</p>
<p>It inspired me to try to apply this approach to the open-ended comments from the employee survey after identifying the topics present in each comment using LLM. IMO this can help with better interpretation of the survey results by providing a broader context of the topics identified, and thus help to more wisely select appropriate follow-up actions.</p>
<p>Let’s check out how this works on sample comments taken from <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a>. You can download the data from Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidgauthier/glassdoor-job-reviews/data" target="_blank">here</a>. To preserve the anonymity of the company whose reviews I will be analyzing, I will not show all the filters used and will upload directly the pre-prepared data, which consists of the cons reported by previous or current employees of one specific company at one specific location as of 2021. Our input data looks as follows.</p>

Switching roles too often can impact utilisation. Try not to get stuck with a generalist consulting through and through average manager as ego can come into play and they may at times give you work you're overqualified for but you're expected to feel grateful for the opportunity . Some Partners aren't generating enough business - don't get tangled in their web, they gift you with lots of low priority/ non client work which may distract you into thinking you're being productive.","Long hours, knowledge expectations and utilisation requirements","Work might be of different than your area of expertise","nothing i can think of really","Long hours but comes with the industry","Long hours, too much red tape","Low pay, no bonuses, partners keep all the money, very little for the actual consultants on the ground","Salary is low.

Not a great place for a long term career.","Pay is relatively low compared to other industries","Poor compensation relative to other big four in normal years (partly driven by Deloitte's regularly claimed highest per partner pay). Exasperated in Covid with no in grade pay rises, and significant reductions to pension contributions and bonuses. Understandable that measures have to be taken but these are in excess of what competitors have done (e.g. PwC). I believe the partners should have borne more of the brunt, given they profit from every good year they should accept the risk of poorer years.","You are expected to work all the hours under the sun and there is just no recognition for junior grades.

It's largely transformation work masquerading as strategy. Lot's of 'investment' that rarely pays off and is actually just discounting. Pay is deeply disappointing, especially when you see how much the partners make. Opportunities limited beyond senior manager level if you enter the firm laterally.","Salary is little less for the amount of work.","too busy, need to work really hard","slow salary progression, lack of ownership over career direction","too much process to little time","Hard work, people can be rude","Lots of hours exceeding the usual 8 hours per day.","Ultimately a disregard for well-being despite a lot of central communication","The pay is low for the working hours.","The risk advisory position I took in Technology Digital Risk was mis sold. It is essentially IT Audit, with the 'chance' of doing advisory work 5+ years down the line if you're lucky (note its about an 80/20 split between IT audit and advisory work anyway). I doubt the advisory work is interesting and worth 5 years of your career regardless.\r\nNo career progression outside of the firm. If you stay long enough, you'll only get Internal Audit opportunities at mid and big size firms. It pigeon-holes you completely.\r\nAs a reference point, a few other grads reached out to me when they heard I was leaving as they were all feeling the same way about the job - seems like everyone is duped into this role in a way.","Harder and harder to make partner","Depending on the team you end up working in, it can be quite bureaucratic","Long hours and pressure if you don't know how to manage your bosses","too political, long hours, no bonus, no pay rises","Bad Management, Awful Office Environment, Management Use Fowl Language WhenSpeaking To You, Expected To Work Long Hours With No Pay, Staff Shout At Each Other, No Training, You Will Need Professional Medical Support if you choose to work here","Relatively poor pay compared to other industries","Sometimes you have to work long hours and tight deadlines","Not paid enough for the amount of work expected","Salary is lower to what competitors offer","- didn't employ on a perm basis (FTC)","A bit bureaucratic, teams are too large, you never work with the same people. every 6 - 8 weeks you change client, colleagues, director and industry which is good if you're at the start of your carrier. but not ideal for experienced hires.

I sincerely hope you will not be deeply disappointed and (hate yourself and) regret the day you accepted their offer.","Other members of call coach will have next to nothing to do while you can at time be doing most of the work.","Other members of call coach will have next to nothing to do while you can at time be doing most of the work.","Work/life balance is non existent for a small portion of the year","Pay could be better aligned to performance (low performers and top performers paid roughly the same)","Outdated salary structure (make little until you hit partner)\nLarge and bureaucratic","Outdated salary structure (make little until you hit partner)\nLarge and bureaucratic","Pressure and work life balance","Pressure and work life balance","limited exit opportunity afterwards which","- Difficult to move between departments \n- Not as agile as it could be\n- Intense workloads","- Difficult to move between departments \n- Not as agile as it could be\n- Intense workloads","- Difficult to move between departments \n- Not as agile as it could be\n- Intense workloads","Some projects can be boring and involve long hours \nA lot of extracurricular work is required to get noticed for promotion \nSalary is not great and can find better elsewhere","Some projects can be boring and involve long hours \nA lot of extracurricular work is required to get noticed for promotion \nSalary is not great and can find better elsewhere","Some projects can be boring and involve long hours \nA lot of extracurricular work is required to get noticed for promotion \nSalary is not great and can find better elsewhere","Some projects can be boring and involve long hours \nA lot of extracurricular work is required to get noticed for promotion \nSalary is not great and can find better elsewhere","say good bye to social life, the more you put in the more you get","Normally there are long hours to work","Sometimes hours can be tough if you don't communicate your workload","Long hours, can be stressful","Long hours, can be stressful","Lack of technical know - how in management often","Long working hours at times","Take over life if you got anything else on forget it","Take over life if you got anything else on forget it","Long working hours during busy season","Salary is lower than other organizations","Some senior positions need to be rotated as they become too distant from juniors personal needs","Some senior positions need to be rotated as they become too distant from juniors personal needs","Hours to pay ratio not good enough","Long working hours, specially now at home","Long working hours, specially now at home","Poor work/life balance, compensation and benefits not up to the energy committed","Poor work/life balance, compensation and benefits not up to the energy committed","Less responsibilities compared to smaller firms","Sometimes difficult to manage work life balance","Demanding, and occasionally psychotic, management","Demanding, and occasionally psychotic, management","Challenging work load and HR structure","Challenging work load and HR structure","Long working times, not work life balance","Long working times, not work life balance","- Resistant to any change with a 'this is how it is done here' mentality.\n\n- Hierarchical; little interface between junior and senior staff with a 20th century culture.\n\n- Long working hours (expected) but dull and with no incentives to work effectively (the expectation of hours worked has little to do with actual output of individuals.

<p>The above table can then be used to create an undirected network object and visualize it using, for example, the <a href="https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/" target="_blank">d3Network package</a> for D3 JavaScript network graphs. The resulting network graph shows the relationships between topics such that topics that are closer together and connected by stronger edges tend to appear more frequently in employee comments. The node size indicates how often the topic occurs together with other topics (degree centrality), and the color codes refer to the communities (clusters) of topics detected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method" target="_blank">Louvain method for community detection</a>. The graph is interactive, so you can zoom in/out and highlight specific parts of the graph you’re interested in.</p>
