Based on advice from more experienced colleagues in the data-science community, I decided to set up my own blog about people analytics topics, so I can at least partially give back what I’ve learned myself through the blogging of others. Besides that, it also gives me an opportunity – and, honestly, a bit of an excuse – to explore and try new things related to people analytics, while at the same time better organizing my thoughts about the subject.

On this blog, I plan to publish articles (mainly in English, but from time to time also in Czech) that will focus more on the technical and analytic aspects of people analytics. Nevertheless, I’ll always try to present individual topics in the context of practical issues that keep HR professionals busy as they work to enhance both *efficiency* and *effectiveness* of HR processes in organizations. In general, my goal is to promote the idea that when critical thinking, reliable and relevant data, and rigorous analysis are combined in people management, organizations stand a much better chance of achieving their strategic and business goals through and with their people.
